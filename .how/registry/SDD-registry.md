# SDD — Registry

As-built baseline: global live templates in SQLite plus a per-Service freeze
(`service_registry_snapshots`, AD-16). **This revision designs the DEC-004 nested shape on top
of that baseline** — none of it is built yet (Evidence table marks every new claim `[MISSING]`,
not `verified`).

## Decision Summary · [outline]

Registry is `/admin/artifacts` plus its API. The main spine stays one ordered list, but a spine
row is now one of exactly two server-owned kinds — `general` or a **Song Set entry** — plus an
`ann-set` marker splicing in an Admin-authored **Announcement Set** (its own ordered list of
Generals, held in its own tables). Every Song Set entry, however many Admin has defined, shares
one canvas trio (Title/Verse/Reff) that lives **outside** the spine, in its own singleton table.
Like every other registry structure, the trio is **frozen into the per-service snapshot at Service
creation** (AD-16, reversed 2026-08-20 from an earlier live-read design — see below); it is not
read live at render time.
Two more Admin-maintained collections join the component: a **Background Library** (images only,
one global default) and a **Song Book** list (one global default), both referenced by weekly/live
choices elsewhere but owned and CRUD'd here. A Predefined Field is now a `{key}` token mixed into
a text element's own content — the closed catalog vocabulary is still a code list (AD-19), not a
table, and an unrecognised token never blocks generation (BR-13); it is flagged only when the
slide is saved.

Two surfaces, unchanged: this component does not take weekly hymn numbers, Song Book choices,
backgrounds, lyric corrections, or live background switches — those are Hub/Presenter (FR-32,
FR-33, FR-34). Announcement composition lives only here now (FR-3 retired, DEC-004); the old
Hub-owned live master list (CAP-7 as-built) is retired by AD-35.

**Physical-shape decision (left open at G3, closed here):** own tables per new concept, not one
overloaded discriminator row. `artifact_templates` keeps carrying the main spine (`general` /
`song-set-entry` / `ann-set-marker`); the shared Title/Verse/Reff trio, an Announcement Set's own
slide list, the Background Library, and the Song Book list each get a dedicated table. Reasoning:
the shared trio is not spine-ordered at all (one Title/Verse/Reff exists no matter how many
entries reference it) and an Announcement Set's slides are ordered *within that set*, not within
the spine — folding either into `artifact_templates`'s single `position` column would make
`position` mean two different things depending on a row's kind, which is exactly the ambiguity
AD-15's stable-id discipline exists to prevent. One overloaded table also cannot express
"exactly 3 rows, never more" for the trio without an application-level rule doing the work a
schema could do for free.

Expensive choices carried forward and one added: seed is bootstrap + Reset only (AD-17); a
deleted row (any of the five tables below) is not revived by restart or Reset (OQ-24). **New:**
Song Set `variable_name` uniqueness and Announcement Set / marker referential integrity are
enforced on the write path in code, never by a DB `UNIQUE`/`FOREIGN KEY` constraint — the same
discipline AD-19 already set for slot identity, extended by AD-31 to the new shape.

Screens (`inventory-screen` row 7) are not an `LC` `ui-screen`: that is a `wdi-ux` slot, skipped.

## Structure · [outline]

| LC | type | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LC-11 | gateway | GET/PUT/DELETE artifacts, POST reset, PUT order (as-built) **+** CRUD for Song Set entries, Announcement Sets and their slides, Background Library, Song Books (new — same gateway, wider surface, not a new `LC`) |
| LC-15 | service | SQLite store + AD-15 validation + snapshot clone (as-built) **+** the five new tables' store logic, `variable_name`/referential checks, migration runner (new — same service, wider surface) |

Direction unchanged: Admin screen → LC-11 → LC-15 → SQLite. Hub/Presenter render through LC-16
(Slide plan builder), not this API. No new `LC` is registered by this design: every new HTTP
surface below is one more resource family under the existing Registry gateway (LC-11), and every
new table is one more responsibility of the existing Registry store (LC-15) — same trust boundary,
same container (`api`), same caller. Registration of any new endpoint row belongs to
`.how/_platform/inventory-api.md` / `inventory-screen.md`, owned by `wdi-blueprint`; this SDD
does not write there (see Drift, below).

## Inherited Constraints · [guarded]

| AD | Quoted rule | How it lands here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AD-5 | The Go API has one request gate, and its path matcher **is** the authorization boundary — anything it does not match is served with no session check at all, so a new exclusion ships together with its assertion test in the same change set. | Every new path below (`/api/admin/song-set-entries*`, `/api/admin/announcement-sets*`, `/api/admin/background-library*`, `/api/admin/song-books*`) sits inside the matcher beside `/api/admin/artifacts*` (AD-14). No new exclusion is added. |
| AD-6 | every service mutation carries the client's `updated_at` as a precondition; a stale value is rejected with HTTP 409 and the client re-reads before retrying. No write path may bypass the precondition. | Every new write (create/rename/delete/reorder/reset) on every new table carries `updatedAt` the same way `artifact_templates` already does. |
| AD-7 | `buildSlidePlan` is the single source of slide order and content for every surface. | Registry supplies spine entries, the trio, Announcement Set slides, and the two libraries; the plan (Hub LC-16) orders and hydrates. |
| AD-8 | image references resolve only through the shared helpers in `src/lib` | Background Library entries and every canvas image element (Main, trio, Announcement Set) resolve through the same helpers — no new image path. |
| AD-9 | schema changes go through the Go API's startup DDL when it opens SQLite. | The five new tables and the migration below ship as startup DDL, not a hand-run script. |
| AD-11 | The live Artifact Registry is stored in SQLite on the durable `DB_PATH` (AD-4). | All new tables live in the same file. |
| AD-12 | a renderer never **reads data from** the registry itself. | Unchanged — plan only. |
| AD-13 | The Canvas Editor uses an Uncontrolled Wrapper pattern. | Unchanged for every canvas surface, including the trio and Announcement Set slides. |
| AD-14 | Artifact templates are global across services. | Unchanged; Admin-only UI for every new surface too. |
| AD-15 | Layouts use a fixed 16:9 canvas with normalized percentage coordinates and stable template/layout/element/placeholder IDs. | Validated on every write, on every canvas-bearing table (trio rows, Announcement Set slides), exactly as `artifact_templates` today. |
| AD-16 | Creating a worship service **clones** the ordered live registry … into a **service-bound snapshot** | Superseded in part by AD-35 for Announcement Sets specifically (below); the general clone-on-create / Sync-only-replace rule is otherwise unchanged and now also clones the referenced Announcement Sets **and the Title/Verse/Reff trio** into the same per-service snapshot (`service_registry_snapshots`) at creation time — **reversed 2026-08-20 (owner ruling): the trio is frozen, not read live.** An earlier draft of this design left the trio unversioned and always-live, resolved fresh at every plan build; the owner ruled freezing is better, so it now joins everything else AD-16 already clones. A live registry edit reaches an existing service's trio only through the same explicit **Sync Artifact** action as every other cloned structure — never automatically. |
| AD-17 | The seeder initialises data **from zero only** — first install, first run — and is gated by a marker in `settings`. | Bootstrap seeds the default four Song Set entries, the Title/Verse/Reff trio, and the two seed Announcement Sets (DEC-004 reference deck) once; delete on any of them stays deleted. |
| AD-18 | A shipped change that must reach rows already persisted travels as an **explicit, one-time migration** on the startup path, versioned per AD-21. | Two numbered migrations, not reseeds: the Song Set physical-shape change (AD-31/AD-33) — `06-flows/song-set-physical-shape-migration.md`, `data_version` 3→4 — runs first, then the Predefined Field key rename/split (S1) — `06-flows/predefined-field-migration.md`, `data_version` 4→5. |
| AD-19 | a key referenced across a boundary is **server-owned vocabulary, enforced on every write path**, and it is never administrator configuration. | Superseded in part by AD-31 for the Song Set/Announcement identities specifically (below); `general`'s closed, non-editable treatment is untouched, and the Predefined Field Catalog's own closed vocabulary is untouched (AD-32). |
| AD-20 | every slide in the deck originates from an ordered registry entry. | Unchanged; the trio and Announcement Set slides are still registry-originated, just not on the spine's own `position` axis. |
| AD-21 | All persisted data shares **one monotonic version number** in `settings` | `data_version` gates the predefined-field migration exactly once. |
| AD-30 | The Go API is the only always-on server: it owns SQLite, assembles the slide plan, and serves JSON | LC-11 / LC-15 on `api`, unchanged; every new surface is more API surface, not a new process. |
| AD-31 | *(quoted in full)* A main-spine row is now one of exactly two remaining server-owned kinds — `general` or a **Song Set entry** — plus an `ann-set` marker that splices in an Announcement Set. `general` keeps AD-19's closed, non-editable treatment exactly as written. A Song Set entry's `variable_name` and title **are** Admin-authored (FR-29): Admin adds, renames, and removes entries directly in the Registry, and a Service with more than four songs is a normal shape the Registry accepts, not a limit worked around. An **Announcement Set** is its own Admin-authored ordered list of General slides (0..N per Registry) — not a fixed kind of main-spine row at all; the spine carries only a marker referencing it. AD-19's uniqueness rule survives in a new shape: at most one live main-spine row may carry a given Song Set `variable_name`, enforced on the write path exactly as AD-19 enforced slot uniqueness — never by a column constraint. | `variable_name` uniqueness check lives in LC-15, run on create and rename; no `UNIQUE` column constraint. Marker→set reference checked the same way, in code. |
| AD-32 | *(quoted in full)* A text Predefined Field is a `{key}` token mixed into one text element's own content, styled once per element — no per-token styling inside the same box. An image Predefined Field keeps its own geometry box exactly as AD-19 already had it; only the text case changes. Hydrate substitutes catalog values into the token positions. An unrecognised token renders as empty text and never blocks generation (FR-30); the editor flags it only when the slide is saved, not at generate time. | Validator (`src/lib/registry/validate.ts`) parses `{key}` inside text-element `content`, checks membership in the renamed catalog (S1), and returns a save-time warning list rather than a rejection for an unrecognised key. Hydrate substitution itself is Hub LC-16's job; Registry validates and stores. |
| AD-33 | *(quoted in full)* Every Song Set entry, however many exist, shares one authored trio: **Title** is a free canvas with its own background, the same authority as `general`. **Verse** and **Reff** are free canvases too, but authored on a **blank** canvas — no background is chosen at authoring time; background resolves at hydrate/live time through AD-34's order. … An **Announcement Set** is its own ordered sequence of `general`-kind slides, held only in the Registry; the main-spine `ann-set` marker that splices it in at its position is not itself a canvas. | `song_set_layouts` table (3 rows: `title`/`verse`/`reff`), each validated and Reset exactly like a General (AD-15); no bounded-surface override record survives. Announcement Set slides live in `announcement_set_slides`, one row per slide, validated the same way. |
| AD-34 | *(quoted in full)* FR-33 lets the Operator change the background of the projected Verse/Reff slide during a live service. … it travels over AD-10's channel carrying the same plan-identity discipline, is visible immediately on the projector, and touches neither the Service payload nor the Registry nor any table. It does not survive past that session … Ownership follows Supplement S11: Admin owns the Background Library and its global default; the Operator owns the moment. | Registry owns and serves the Background Library table and its default flag (UC-25); the live switch itself (UC-27) is a Presenter-owned session action over AD-10's channel and never calls into this component's write path. |
| AD-35 | *(quoted in full)* An Announcement Set and the `ann-set` marker referencing it on the main spine are structural rows exactly like every General and Song Set row … **creating a Service clones the whole spliced structure** — the main spine plus every Announcement Set it references — into the service-bound snapshot, and only Sync Artifact replaces it thereafter. There is no separate, unscoped, live-reaching membership list any more. | Service creation / Sync (Hub LC-2) calls into LC-15's clone routine, which now also walks every referenced `ann_set_id` and clones its `announcement_set_slides` rows into the snapshot tables (below), not just the spine. |

AD-1, AD-2, AD-4, AD-10, AD-24 are not quoted here (OQ-30): they bind the container / chrome, not
Registry rows.

## Failure Behaviour · [guarded]

Boundaries = inventory-api rows 25–28, 31–32, 37–38 (as-built, unchanged) plus the **new**
resource families below — none has a platform inventory row yet (see Drift). Process timeout: Go
API. Registry does not retry to the client; Admin presses again.

As-built rows (`/api/admin/artifacts*`) are unchanged from the prior SDD revision and are not
repeated here in full; see git history of this file for that table. New surfaces:

| POST `/api/admin/song-set-layouts/[role]/reset` | Reset until browser timeout | 403; unknown role → 404 | Stale `updatedAt` → 409 | Layout returns to seed; same Reset semantics as a General (AD-33 retires the old override record) | console.error on 500 |

| GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE `/api/admin/announcement-sets/[id]/slides*` | Same shape as `/api/admin/artifacts*` (§ as-built), scoped to one set | 403; missing set/slide → 404 | Same validation/version conflicts as a General | Same as editing any General, scoped to that set's own ordered list | console.error on 500 |
| GET `/api/admin/background-library` | List fetch until browser timeout | 403 | — | Image list + which one is default | console.error on 500 |

Plan read (Hub LC-16, `loadRegistrySnapshot` or the service freeze): a corrupt row in any of the
new tables is omitted from the Deck and logged with id + reason, same as today (AD-17) — never
silently re-seeded. An unrecognised `{key}` token (AD-32, BR-13) is not a failure at generate time
at all: it renders empty and the Deck still completes; the editor's save-time flag is the only
place it is visible before then. Sync Artifact (UC-16) remains Hub's route; it now also clones
every referenced Announcement Set's slides (AD-35). Do not invent a Registry Sync route.

## Robustness Analysis · [deep]

**ABCE pass** (Boundary → Control → Entity → Behaviour), new for this revision:

| Object | Kind | Realizes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/admin/artifacts` (extended) | Boundary (screen) | UC-14, UC-15, UC-24, UC-25 | One screen gains song-set-entry, background-library, and song-book panels; `01-ux/` is `wdi-ux`'s slot, skipped here |
| `/api/admin/song-set-entries*` | Boundary (gateway, LC-11) | UC-24 | — |
| `/api/admin/song-set-layouts/[role]*` | Boundary (gateway, LC-11) | UC-14 | — |
| `/api/admin/announcement-sets*` | Boundary (gateway, LC-11) | UC-15, UC-24-style add/remove | — |
| `/api/admin/background-library*` | Boundary (gateway, LC-11) | UC-25 | — |
| `/api/admin/song-books*` | Boundary (gateway, LC-11) | UC-25 (S3 extends its scope) | S3 names Song Book selection as part of registry's admin surface |
| Registry store (LC-15, extended) | Control | All of the above | Validation, uniqueness, referential checks, snapshot clone, migration runner |
| `SongSetEntry` | Entity | UC-24 | `variable_name` identity (AD-31) |
| `SongSetLayoutTrio` (title/verse/reff rows) | Entity | UC-14 | Singleton set of 3, shared (AD-33); the live table Admin edits — a Service reads its own frozen copy in `service_registry_snapshots`, never this table directly (AD-16, reversed 2026-08-20) |
| `AnnouncementSet` / `AnnouncementSetSlide` | Entity | UC-15 | 0..N sets, each its own ordered slide list (AD-33, BR-12) |
| `BackgroundLibraryImage` | Entity | UC-25 | Images only (S10), one default |
| `SongBook` | Entity | UC-25 (S3) | One default, referenced by `hymns.book_code` |
| Deck hydrate (Hub LC-16) | Behaviour | UC-20 | Reads the Service's frozen snapshot (spine, trio, referenced Announcement Sets — AD-16), plus the always-live Background Library and Song Book lookups; substitutes tokens; resolves background order (AD-33/34); never writes back |

| UC | Boundary in | Control | Entity | Boundary out |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UC-15 | `/admin/artifacts` + LC-11 | LC-15 | ArtifactTemplate, AnnouncementSet, AnnouncementSetSlide | ordered list; gone survives boot |
| UC-24 | `/admin/artifacts` (song-set panel) + LC-11 | LC-15 | SongSetEntry | spine gains/loses an entry; Hub form (FR-32) reflects it without a deploy |
| UC-25 | `/admin/artifacts` (library panels) + LC-11 | LC-15 | BackgroundLibraryImage, SongBook | weekly/live surfaces resolve through the new default |

UC-14 and UC-16 are not `critical`. UC-20 is Operator-facing plan consume (Hub/Presenter);
Registry supplies entries only (AD-7, AD-12). UC-16 is a Hub surface; do not invent a Registry
Sync route. Delete flow: `06-flows/delete-template.md`. New flows: `06-flows/copy-paste-share-by-reference.md`,
`06-flows/predefined-field-migration.md`, `06-flows/song-set-physical-shape-migration.md`. `01-ux/`
canvas belongs to `wdi-ux` (skipped).

## Evidence

| Claim | Label | Read to decide | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `artifact_templates` table exists | verified | `src/lib/db/index.ts` | — |
| Per-Service snapshot table | verified | `service_registry_snapshots`; clone in `src/lib/registry/service-snapshot.ts` | W1 / AD-16 |
| `song_set_layouts`, `announcement_sets`, `announcement_set_slides`, `background_library_images`, `song_books` tables | verified | `internal/db/schema.sql` (all five present); migrations `internal/db/migrate_song_book_metadata.go` (8→9) and `internal/db/migrate_announcement_items_cascade.go` (9→10) | **Corrected 2026-08-21.** This row read `[MISSING]` — "none exist yet" — which was true when the design was written and false once W3/W4 shipped. Kept rather than deleted per the evidence ladder: the sentence is the only record that the design once predicted them. `data_version` is now 10 |
| Song Set is a singular `base_type: 'song-set'` today (the `songset-*` per-slot extension the code comments anticipate was never built), and the shipped seed carries **five** such rows, not four — the fifth (`id: "song-set"`) drives Hub's `case "song-set":` loop over `c.dsMiddle`, not a fixed slot | verified | `src/lib/registry/types.ts:2-29` (`ARTIFACT_BASE_TYPES`, `kindOf`); `data/default-registry.json` (5 `base_type: "song-set"` rows, positions 4/9/15/20/25); `internal/plan/plan.go:354-359` | AD-31 retires this; migration designed in full — `06-flows/song-set-physical-shape-migration.md` |
| Predefined Field is a whole-element `placeholderKey` binding today | verified | `src/lib/registry/placeholder-catalog.ts:15-28` | AD-32 retires this; `06-flows/predefined-field-migration.md` |
| `hymns.book_code` is the lookup key: every hymn resolves on the pair `(book_code, number)` | verified | one resolver with a documented fallback (weekly `song_set_inputs.song_book_code` → the global default in `song_books` → the shipped constant); `internal/plan/snapshot.go` JOIN, `internal/httpapi/hymns.go`, `src/lib/lyrics.ts` | **Corrected 2026-08-21.** Previously "exists but nothing reads it". The number-only JOIN meant two installed books answered for each other |
| `song_books` selection table exists, with `locale`, `licence` and `provenance` | verified | `internal/db/schema.sql`; AD-26 metadata columns added by migration 8→9 | **Corrected 2026-08-21.** Previously "No `song_books` selection table exists". The handler validated `locale` and discarded it until the columns landed — that gap is closed |
| Announcement composition is Registry-owned; Hub owns none of it | verified | the five `/api/announcements` routes and their handler are deleted; `src/lib/announcements.ts` keeps only URL hardening, still used by `src/lib/slide-plan.ts` | **Corrected 2026-08-21.** Previously "a Hub-owned live list today". `announcement_items` is deliberately **not** dropped and no longer cascades from a Service delete (migration 9→10); the webhook still accepts `announcements[]` and ignores it (OQ-42) |
| Sync Artifact HTTP route | verified | `internal/httpapi` | Hub surface; not a Registry inventory row |
| Reset on a gone id does not revive | verified | `internal/httpapi` returns 404 before seed lookup | OQ-24; same discipline extends to every new table |
| `RegistrySnapshot` in code is the live map, not the AD-16 freeze | [PARTIAL] | `src/lib/artifacts/registry-snapshot.ts` | do not mix the names |
| `zIndex` is persisted only on a real reorder of existing elements | verified | `src/lib/registry/canvas-utils.ts` (`isOrderModified` is `hasReorderedExisting \|\| hasReorderedAdded`); guards AC-06 and AC-07 in `tests/artifact-editor-controls.test.mjs` | Insert gives the new element a `zIndex` above the maximum and leaves siblings' stored values untouched; delete leaves every survivor's untouched. Insert, reorder and delete are three separate triggers and a guard on one covers neither other — an unconditional rewrite renumbered the 40 seed layouts whose stored `zIndex` is not dense, twice, before this was closed. Both the PPTX exporter and the slideshow paint in `zIndex` order, so this decides what reaches the congregation |
| Preview row titles resolve through four sources before a fallback | verified | `src/components/SlidePreviewList.tsx`; `previewLabel`/`kindChipLabel` in `src/lib/artifacts/preview-model.ts`; source-scan guard in `tests/artifact-preview.test.mjs` | `slide.title` → `entry.label` → the kind chip → `slide.kind` → a translated last-resort string. A label blank after trimming falls through rather than rendering an empty row. The hardcoded `Untitled Slide` literal is gone — it was also the one untranslated user-facing string on this surface |
| Sync Artifact reports success and refreshes the preview in place | verified | `src/operator/SyncArtifactButton.tsx`; `tests/no-router-refresh-guard.test.mjs` | Its old confirmation promised announcement flyers would survive, which FR-3's retirement made false. Success now raises a toast and the parent re-fetches, never `router.refresh()` or `navigate(0)` — those remount the route and blank the page. A refresh that fails after a successful sync is currently swallowed: **OQ-45** |
| Numeric timeout per route | [ASSUMED] | did not read `maxDuration` | platform default |
| A gone `variable_name` may be reused by a later entry with no special guard | [ASSUMED] | DEC-004/S2 is silent | smallest reasonable choice; report at G4 close (see Report) |
| A gone `AnnouncementSet` still referenced by a live marker is rejected on delete, marker must go first | [ASSUMED] | DEC-004/AD-35 does not state the guard explicitly | smallest reasonable choice; state-machines.md, this SDD |
| `reference`/`text` split (S1) cannot be told apart from the payload alone between scripture vs theme purpose | resolved | S1 gives the target keys; disambiguation rule is per-slide `artifact_templates.id`, verified executable against `data/default-registry.json` (`verse-reading` line ~331, `bible-verse-contemplation` line ~804) | Owner ruling 2026-08-20, resolved inline — `06-flows/predefined-field-migration.md` § Disambiguation; never filed as a `wdi-question` (none exists in `.control/questions/`), so the earlier `[NEEDS CONFIRMATION]`/routing note in this row was stale and is corrected here |

Disambiguation and the Evidence table above (this line previously claimed it was routed to
