# Inventory — tables

Derived by `inventory.py` from `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in `src/lib/db/index.ts`. Numbers are stable; new rows take the next number. Numbers 12–13 were never live tables (one-shot rebuild names) and MUST NOT be reused.

## Findings

- Rows 12 (`hymns_with_book_code`) and 13 (`bible_verses_with_translation_code`) were catalogued as live tables. They are one-shot rebuild names in the same DDL file, then `RENAME TO` the live tables. Dropped from the rows; those numbers MUST NOT be reused. W1's freeze table is therefore **14**.
- `service_registry_snapshots` is Registry-owned (AD-16). `services.registry_snapshot_at` is a Hub column on table 1, not a separate table.
- **Plan vs code (DEC-004, not yet built):** table 3 (`announcement_items`, hub-owned) is retired by this decision — composition moves to the Registry as Announcement Sets nested inside `artifact_templates` or a sibling table (G4 design call). Song Set Entry, Background Library, and per-Service Lyric Override have no table yet. None are added as rows here: the code that would create them does not exist, and this inventory is derived from what runs, not from a decision not yet implemented.
