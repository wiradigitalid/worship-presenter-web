# Contract — Remote control relay

## Source of truth

Nothing yet. **Every row below is `[MISSING]`** — FR-35 is promised and unbuilt, and this file is a
design, not an as-built record. The transport is this document's choice to make (G4); DEC-006 left it
open on purpose and `.what/_prd/operator-turn/addendum.md` § *FR-35* carries the candidate.

## Purpose

UC-29, FR-35, AD-37. Carries an Operator's control intents from a remote device to **the presenting
client**, which stays the only sender the projector follows. It is **not** a second presenter channel:
the remote never joins `BroadcastChannel`, and AD-10's laptop-to-projector leg is untouched by
everything here.

## The shape chosen, and why

**Server-Sent Events for server-to-client, ordinary POST for client-to-server.** Two streams, one per
role, both bounded by AD-37:

- The **presenting client** holds an open `GET` stream and receives intents.
- The **remote** POSTs an intent, and holds its own `GET` stream to receive the mirrored session state
  so the phone shows the same presenter view.

Chosen over WebSocket because it needs nothing beyond the Go standard library, survives nginx and
Cloudflare without upgrade configuration, and is one-directional per stream — which is the same shape
as a topology with exactly one controller. WebSocket remains available if bidirectional low latency is
ever shown to be needed; that would be a new decision, not a refactor.

Rejected: polling. An Operator advancing a slide expects the room to follow now, and an interval short
enough to feel immediate is a stream with extra steps.

## Operations

| Operation | Purpose | Realizes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/present/{id}/remote/pair` | The presenting client claims the **presenting role** for this Service and receives a short-lived code to display. Claiming the role is what makes it *the* presenting client — see *Who is the presenting client* below | UC-29 |
| `POST /api/present/{id}/remote/claim` | The remote presents that code and is bound to **one** presenting client | UC-29 · AD-37 |
| `GET /api/present/{id}/remote/stream` | The role-scoped SSE stream: intents to the presenting client, mirrored state to the remote | UC-29 |
| `POST /api/present/{id}/remote/intent` | The remote sends one intent: index, `blank`, `transition`, `background`, `scripture`, `clear-scripture` | UC-29 |
| `DELETE /api/present/{id}/remote/pair` | Either side ends the pairing deliberately | UC-29 |

**No new intent vocabulary is minted.** Those six are exactly the `PresentMessage` variants that
already exist (`src/lib/present-channel.ts`); the relay carries them, it does not extend them. A
seventh intent is a change to that module first, under AD-10, and only then to this contract.

## Five lanes

| Lane | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication | AD-5's gate matcher covers all five paths, and the assertion test ships in the same change set. Signed in as Operator is **necessary and not sufficient**: an intent is accepted only from a remote holding a live pairing for that presenting client. AD-37 states this — reaching a screen is a deliberate act, never a consequence of authentication. **The code is the only thing that authorises a claim.** An earlier draft of this contract said a claim from someone *not presenting* is refused, which is incoherent: the remote is by definition not the presenting client, and the server cannot tell two devices of one account apart. What a claim proves is possession of a code that was displayed on the screen being driven — which is exactly the deliberate act AD-37 asks for, and it is why the code's lifetime is a security parameter and not a convenience one (OQ-53). |
| Validation | The intent body must be one of the six existing variants, shape-checked against the shared module's union. An unknown `type` is 400, not ignored — a silently dropped intent looks to the Operator like a dead remote. `planIdentity` travels with every intent and a mismatch is refused (AD-10, unchanged): the remote may be looking at a deck the laptop no longer has. |
| Error handling | **The room screen is never a casualty.** A relay that is slow, down, or restarted changes nothing about the laptop-to-projector path (AD-37): the presenting client keeps its `BroadcastChannel` and keeps driving. The remote shows its own connection as lost and stops accepting input rather than queueing intents to replay later — a slide advanced three minutes ago is not an instruction any more. A pairing whose presenting stream has gone is refused with 409 and the remote is told to pair again. |
| Rate limiting | One pairing per presenting client at a time; a second claim on a live pairing is refused rather than silently taking over, because two remotes is two controllers by another route (OQ-54). **A second `pair` while a code is already outstanding replaces it and invalidates the first** — two live codes for one screen is two keys to one door, and the older one is the one nobody is watching any more. Codes are single-use and expire; the window is short and exported once so both ends agree on one number, the same discipline AD-29 sets for the heartbeat pair. |
| Idempotency | Intents are **intended values**, not deltas — `blank: true`, an absolute index — so a duplicate POST is harmless and a lost one is corrected by the next. This is the property that makes an unreliable phone network survivable without a queue, and it is why no sequence number or ack pairing is layered on (AD-29's reasoning, applied to this leg). |

## Who is the presenting client

Nothing in the URL answers this, and it has to be answered before any of the above is buildable: two
laptops may both open `/services/{id}/present` for the same Service, and AD-29 already paid for the
neighbouring version of this problem — a slideshow tab answering as the projector would report a live
second screen while the hall was dark.

**The presenting role is claimed, not inferred.** `POST …/remote/pair` claims it for the caller and its
stream; a second client claiming it takes the role and the first is told it lost it, rather than both
believing they hold it. The pairing is keyed to that **role**, not to a stream connection, which is what
lets a remote's own network drop and return without re-pairing while a **presenting** client that goes
away ends the pairing. That asymmetry is deliberate: the remote is disposable and the presenting client
is the thing the projector follows.

Whether a presenting client reloading its page keeps the role is the narrow open question: **OQ-55**.

## Where the pairing lives

In the Go process's **memory**, in no table. It needs no startup DDL (AD-9) and no `data_version` bump
(AD-21), and an API restart ends every pairing rather than resurrecting one nobody remembers granting.
That is a deliberate trade: a restart mid-service costs the Operator a walk to the laptop, and the
alternative — a durable pairing table — buys convenience with a migration and a row that outlives the
session it describes. Whether a pairing should survive the presenting client's own page reload is a
narrower question and is open: **OQ-55**.

## What this contract MUST NOT become

- A path from the remote to the projector. The projector follows the presenting client and nothing else
  (AD-10 *Prevents*, AD-29).
- A way to edit a Service, the Registry, or a weekly value. It carries live control intents only.
- A dependency of the venue. If this whole file were deleted at runtime the service would continue.

## Evidence

| Claim | Label | Read to decide | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Every path, handler, stream and pairing store above | `[MISSING]` | `internal/httpapi/server.go` — no `/api/present/*` route exists; no SSE anywhere in the tree | FR-35 is promised and unbuilt. Planned work, not a `BUG-` |
| The six intents already exist as `PresentMessage` variants | verified | `src/lib/present-channel.ts` | Nothing new is minted; the relay carries them |
| No realtime transport exists in the repository today | verified | no match for `text/event-stream`, WebSocket, or `EventSource` under `internal/`, `src/`, `spa/` | DEC-006 admits the first one |
