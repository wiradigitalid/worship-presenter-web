# LC-14 — Presenter session

## Responsibility

Coordinate index, blank, overlay, live background override, and liveness between the controls and the
projector.

## Depends on

LC-10 (channel) · LC-9 (verse) · LC-16 (plan, owned by Hub)

## Interface

State in window memory + channel messages. Not a table.

Blank covers overlay without clearing it. Required (OQ-25): `request-sync` answers with index, overlay, and blank. Required (OQ-26): verse lookup is refused while liveness is not `live`. As-built: overlay-on-sync and no-projector refuse are [MISSING] — see SDD Evidence. Plan identity is not on the message (AD-10, OQ-26).

Required (UC-27, FR-33, AD-34): the session holds one live background override, applying to every Verse/Reff
slide for the rest of the session; it is never written anywhere durable, and `request-sync` must resend it
exactly as it resends index/overlay/blank. As-built: no `background` variant exists on `PresentMessage` yet
— [MISSING], see SDD Evidence.

## Notes

`src/lib/present-channel.ts`, AD-29 liveness evaluator. Overlay-on-sync, no-projector refuse, and the live
background override are [MISSING] in code; see SDD Evidence.
