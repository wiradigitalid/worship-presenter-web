# Inventory — endpoints of Hub

Numbers match `.how/_platform/inventory-api.md` for Hub-owned rows. Spec per resource, not per verb.

## Rows

| No | Method | Path | Spec file | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | POST | `/api/auth/login` | `01-auth.md` | published |
| 2 | POST | `/api/auth/logout` | `01-auth.md` | published |
| 3 | POST | `/api/auth/change-password` | `01-auth.md` | published |
| 4 | GET | `/api/services` | `02-services.md` | published |
| 5 | POST | `/api/services` | `02-services.md` | published |
| 6 | PUT | `/api/services/[id]` | `02-services.md` | published |
| 7 | DELETE | `/api/services/[id]` | `02-services.md` | published |
| 8 | GET | `/api/services/[id]/pptx` | `02-services.md` | published |
| 30 | POST | `/api/webhook` | `08-webhook.md` | published |
| 33 | POST | `/api/services/[id]/sync-artifact` | `02-services.md` | published |
| 11 | POST | `/api/announcements` | `03-announcements.md` | retired |
| 12 | PUT | `/api/announcements` | `03-announcements.md` | retired |
| 13 | PATCH | `/api/announcements/[id]` | `03-announcements.md` | retired |
| 14 | DELETE | `/api/announcements/[id]` | `03-announcements.md` | retired |
| N/A | PUT | `/api/services/[id]/song-sets` (proposed) | `02-services.md` | proposed — needs a number in `.how/_platform/inventory-api.md` (out of this component's scope, reported) |
| N/A | POST | `/api/services/[id]/song-sets/[variableName]/save-to-book` (proposed) | `02-services.md` | proposed — same numbering gap; designed, not blocked — the AD-25 drift note in `05-model/data-model.md` is closed by DEC-005/AD-36, with one build-order constraint (the AD-36 bootstrap-once migration must land first) |
| 15 | POST | `/api/upload` | `04-upload.md` | published |
| 16 | POST | `/api/upload/from-url` | `04-upload.md` | published |
| 17 | GET | `/api/uploads/[filename]` | `04-upload.md` | published |
| 18 | GET | `/api/hymns` | `05-hymns.md` | published |
| 19 | GET | `/api/admin/accounts` | `06-accounts.md` | published |
| 20 | POST | `/api/admin/accounts` | `06-accounts.md` | published |
| 21 | PATCH | `/api/admin/accounts/[id]` | `06-accounts.md` | published |
| 22 | DELETE | `/api/admin/accounts/[id]` | `06-accounts.md` | published |
| 23 | GET | `/api/admin/settings` | `07-settings.md` | published |
| 24 | PUT | `/api/admin/settings` | `07-settings.md` | published |
| 30 | POST | `/api/webhook` | `08-webhook.md` | published |

## Findings

- Numbers 25–29 and 31–32 belong to Registry/Presenter in the platform inventory; not used here. 33 is Hub Sync Artifact (UC-16).
- No OpenAPI; prose contracts. Source: `internal/httpapi`.
- POST `/api/webhook` (30) is as-built CAP-11 later; this phase's create path is POST `/api/services` (UC-2).
- **DEC-004 (2026-08-20):** rows 11–14 (`/api/announcements*`) retire with FR-3 — see
  `03-announcements.md`. Two new operations are needed for FR-32/FR-34 (Song Set weekly inputs and
  the explicit lyric save-to-book action) but have no number yet: this component cannot assign one
  without editing `.how/_platform/inventory-api.md`, which is out of scope here and is reported to the
  platform/blueprint owner instead.
