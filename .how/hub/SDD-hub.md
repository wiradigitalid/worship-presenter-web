# SDD — Hub

Target: Hub UI on `spa`, APIs and plan on `api`, PPTX on `pptx-worker` (DEC-003 / AD-30). As-built: Go API in `cmd/api`, operator UI in `spa/`, shared modules in `src/`.

## Decision Summary · [outline]

Hub is the Operator SPA surface: Service list, form, Run-Sheet, generate/download PPTX, accounts, settings. This phase's intake is the Operator Hub form (`/services/new`, UC-2). `POST /api/webhook` / LC-8 remains on the Go API as last-phase CAP-11 intake (AD-3: JSON agnostic of picoclaw); it is as-built, not this phase's handover.

**DEC-004 (2026-08-20) narrows and grows Hub's form at once.** Announcement composition leaves Hub
entirely — the form only previews how the Registry's Announcement Sets expand (FR-3 retired). In its
place, two things the form did not do before: a Song Set group per Registry-configured entry, replacing
four hardcoded song fields (FR-32), and an inline per-entry lyric editor with a this-service-only
default and a separate explicit save-to-book action (FR-34) — the latter was blocked on a conflict with
AD-25, now closed by **DEC-005 / AD-36** (see `05-model/data-model.md` § *Resolved*). **Both have
shipped:** the bootstrap-once path landed first, as required, and the route is as-built at
`internal/httpapi/server.go:41` (`POST /api/services/{id}/song-sets/{variableName}/save-to-book`).

Two expensive choices reversed: (1) one authorization gate on the Go API plus a SQLite check per request (AD-5); (2) PPTX as the Sabbath guarantee, not the slideshow (AD-1).

## Structure · [outline]

| LC | type | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LC-1 | gateway | login / logout / change password |
| LC-2 | gateway | Service CRUD, preview, PPTX, Sync Artifact, Song Set weekly inputs + lyric override (DEC-004) |
| ~~LC-3~~ | ~~gateway~~ | ~~announcement list~~ — **retired** (DEC-004, FR-3 retired); see `02-contracts/03-announcements.md` |
| LC-4 | gateway | upload and read images |
| LC-5 | gateway | Admin accounts |
| LC-6 | gateway | settings (transition, locale, default corpus) |
| LC-7 | gateway | search hymns |
| LC-8 | gateway | picoclaw webhook — CAP-11 later; as-built, still specified |
| LC-12 | service | parse Rundown + write Service |
| LC-13 | job | generate PPTX |
| LC-16 | service | `buildSlidePlan` (also used by Presenter) |

Direction: Hub screens → LC-1…LC-7 → LC-12…; picoclaw → LC-8 is later (CAP-11). All SQLite is in `web`.

Screens (`inventory-screen` 1–6) are not yet `LC` `ui-screen`: that is a `wdi-ux` slot, skipped at the owner's request.

## Inherited Constraints · [guarded]

Quotes are the spine **Rule** sentences. Full text in `.how/_platform/ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md`. ADs that do not bind Hub (AD-10, AD-11, AD-13–AD-15, AD-17–AD-22, AD-27, AD-29) are not listed.

| AD | Quoted rule | How it lands here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AD-1 | Operators use a zero-install **Web Hub** for review/run-sheet. **Phase 1** presents on Sabbath from a downloadable offline **PPTX**. | PPTX download is the guarantee; the slideshow is a complementary link. |
| AD-2 | The picoclaw skill integration logic, the Go API, the React SPA, and the Node PPTX worker reside in a single repository and deploy as a cohesive unit. | One repo; Hub lives in `api` + `spa` + `pptx-worker`. |
| AD-4 | Production is one always-on Go API process on host storage (systemd on VPS / LiveServer behind a tunnel) | Durable `DB_PATH` on the Go process. |
| AD-5 | The Go API has one request gate, and its path matcher **is** the authorization boundary — anything it does not match is served with no session check at all | `/api/webhook` is `WEBHOOK_SECRET` only. Session expiry at save/delete is this gate's 401 before the handler (OQ-23). As-built until cutover: `internal/gate`. |
| AD-3 | The API must expose a standard JSON interface for service generation that is agnostic to the input mechanism (Telegram/picoclaw). | Hub form writes Service now; LC-8 writes the same Service later (CAP-11). |
| AD-6 | every service mutation carries the client's `updated_at` as a precondition; a stale value is rejected with HTTP 409 and the client re-reads before retrying. | PUT Service (UC-5). POST sync-artifact (UC-16). GET pptx / POST preview are not mutations (OQ-20). Half of the agent paths are not yet closed (deferred-work). |
| AD-7 | `buildSlidePlan` is the single source of slide order and content for every surface. | Preview and PPTX do not re-order from Service fields. |
| AD-12 | `buildSlidePlan` outputs a fully hydrated AST (Fat Payload) with exact rendering coordinates, fonts, colors, and resolved text content. | Preview and PPTX consume the fat plan; they do not look up Registry. |
| AD-8 | image references resolve only through the shared helpers in `src/lib` — allowlisted remote http(s) and hub-local `/api/uploads/<32-hex>.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp)` for announcements, and registry `/assets/...` refs for Artifact templates. | LC-4 and announcements. |
| AD-9 | schema changes go through the Go API's startup DDL when it opens SQLite. | No Prisma. `services.registry_snapshot_at` is Hub; the freeze table is Registry. |
| AD-16 | Creating a worship service **clones** the ordered live registry … into a **service-bound snapshot** | Create clones in the same transaction. Sync is `POST /api/services/[id]/sync-artifact`, Admin-only. Preview stays live. |
| AD-23 | transition style is **one app-wide value** in `settings` (`slide_transition`), and each style is described **exactly once**, in `src/lib/transitions.ts`, carrying both its PowerPoint element and its browser animation parameters. | LC-6 writes; PPTX reads. |
| AD-24 | **application state reaches one of three homes and *who must agree on it* picks which.** | `ui_locale` in settings, not a chrome cookie. |
| AD-25 | A **shipped reference corpus** — a committed data file the product carries so that a fresh clone resolves a verse and a hymn offline — is **developer-owned data with exactly one writer**, and the committed file is authoritative. | Superseded here: the song-book half is carved out by **AD-36** (DEC-005) — `hymns` and the `song_books` registry row are administrator-owned after bootstrap, not a corpus projection. AD-25 binds nothing Hub owns; it continues to govern only the bible family, which Hub does not own. |
| AD-26 | Every installed corpus is a **registered entity** — one row in `bible_translations` or `song_books`, carrying its code, display name, **locale**, licence and provenance. | Hymn picker / default book. |
| AD-28 | there is **one matcher implementation and the scope is an argument to it, never a fork**. | Rundown: every installed translation. |
| AD-30 | The Go API is the only always-on server: it owns SQLite, assembles the slide plan, and serves JSON (and, in production, the SPA files). | Hub APIs + LC-16 on `api`; UI on `spa`; LC-13 on `pptx-worker`. |
| AD-31 | "A Song Set entry's `variable_name` and title **are** Admin-authored (FR-29): Admin adds, renames, and removes entries directly in the Registry, and a Service with more than four songs is a normal shape the Registry accepts, not a limit worked around." | Hub reads the live entry list (same-process, `artifact_templates` `base_type = 'song-set-entry'`), never authors it; the Service form's Song Set group repeats once per entry, not four fixed fields (FR-32, `05-model/form-fields.md`). |
| AD-34 | "A live background choice ... travels over AD-10's channel ... It does not survive past that session — the next generate, and any Sync, resolves the background through AD-33's normal order ... exactly as if the live override had never happened." | Hub's `song_set_inputs.background_id` is the **weekly** choice only; Hub never reads or writes a live in-service background override — that stays on the presenter/projector channel entirely outside this component. |
| AD-35 | "Creating a Service **clones** the whole spliced structure — the main spine plus every Announcement Set it references — into the service-bound snapshot, and only Sync Artifact replaces it thereafter." | LC-12's create/Sync clone widens from "spine only" to "spine + every spliced Announcement Set"; `announcement_items`'s old live-membership shape (superseded AD-16 clause) is gone from Hub's model. |
| AD-36 | *(Rule, quoted)* "A song book's rows in `hymns`, **and its own row in `song_books`, are bootstrapped once, from the committed corpus file, and are administrator-owned data from that moment on** … **A corpus-level correction to an already-installed book — content or its registry metadata — reaches a live database only as an explicit, numbered data migration** under the single `data_version` counter (AD-18, AD-21) — **never as a boot-time reconcile** and never a second counter." | `upsertHymns` becomes insert-only-for-absent-rows, gated by a per-book-code marker; that migration is the precondition for LC-2's save-to-book route (UC-28) to ship — see `06-flows/lyric-save-to-book.md`. **The marker gates corpus-seeding only** (whether the shipped file's hymns get bulk-inserted for that `book_code`) — it never gates an administrator's own per-row write, so authoring hymns one at a time into an admin-created book (`02-contracts/05-song-books.md`) and the save-to-book override (UC-28) both work regardless of whether the marker is set. |

## Failure Behaviour · [guarded]

Hub does not retry a failed call; the Operator (or picoclaw) must press again. Process timeout is the Go API default — [ASSUMED], never read as a number. The `route.ts` files that phrase once referred to are gone: DEC-003 retired the Next.js shape and the operator UI is a Vite SPA under `spa/` with shared modules in `src/`. The one named timeout is `POST /api/upload/from-url`: `REMOTE_IMAGE_TIMEOUT_MS = 8000` in `src/lib/remote-image.ts`.

This phase's create boundary is `/services/new` (UC-2). `POST /api/webhook` is as-built CAP-11 later; do not treat it as this phase's handover.

Every Hub-owned row in `.how/_platform/inventory-api.md` — **24 rows** after the 2026-08-22 refresh
(commit `0b24d5e`) — plus `inventory-screen.md` 1–6. Rows 10–14 (`/api/announcements*`) are retired
(DEC-004, FR-3) and now sit in that file's `## Retired` section. Save-to-book is **numbered 67**; the
separate Song Set PUT this design proposed was never built (see its row below).

| Boundary | Slow | Absent | Lying | What the user sees | What is logged |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST `/api/auth/login` | Browser waits until the process default | 500 `{ error: Internal Server Error }` | Wrong user/password → 401 same `Invalid username or password`; lockout → 429 + `Retry-After`; short `AUTH_SECRET` → 503 | Sign-in form: failed credentials, wait message, or host-not-ready | 500: `Login error:` (`internal/httpapi`). 503: `AUTH_SECRET is missing or shorter than 16 characters`. 401/429: not logged |
| POST `/api/auth/logout` | Browser waits | Revocation write fails → 500 `Logout failed`; cookie **kept** so the browser is still signed in | Already signed out: still 200/303 and cookie cleared | JSON `{ ok: true }` or redirect to `/login`. On 500: still on Hub, still signed in | `Logout revocation failed:` (`internal/httpapi`) |
| POST `/api/auth/change-password` | Browser waits | 500 `{ error }` | Wrong current password → 401 `Current password is incorrect`; lockout → 429 + `Retry-After`; no session → 401 from gate | Form shows that message; password hash unchanged | `Password change error:` on 500 (`internal/httpapi`) |
| GET `/api/services` | List JSON delayed | 500 `{ error: Internal Server Error }` | Search `q` is a substring filter; a corrupt row still appears in the list | Hub list spinner then rows, or a failed fetch — not a silent empty Hub pretending there are no Services | `Error listing services:` (`internal/httpapi`) |
| POST `/api/services` | Timeout; a 201 retry may already have inserted | 500 | No date / empty paste → 400, no row (OQ-21). Same date without `allowSecond` → 409 + `existingId` (OQ-8). Unparseable body **with** a date → 201 and `failedHymnNumbers` (NFR-5, OQ-22) | Form: miss named, or existing Service offered, or incomplete Service saved | `Error creating service:` on 500. 400/409: not logged |
| PUT `/api/services/[id]` | Timeout; no write if the gate already 401'd | Row gone → 404 `Service not found` (UC-7; do not recreate, OQ-23) | Stale `updated_at` → 409, no write (BR-4). Bad id → 400 | Run-Sheet: conflict alert then refresh; gone → not-found page after refresh; session expiry → 401, fields not stored | `Error updating service:` on 500. 409/404: not logged |
| DELETE `/api/services/[id]` | Timeout; a successful delete already unlinked files | 404 `Service not found` | Bad id → 400. Session expiry → 401 **before** the handler; no partial write (OQ-23) | Confirm dialog then list without the row, or `Error deleting service` alert | `Error deleting service:` on 500 (`internal/httpapi`). Unlink misses: `Error unlinking service upload:` (`src/lib/services/queries.ts`) |
| GET `/api/services/[id]/pptx` | Generate waits (UC-6 / UC-18); does **not** edit the Service (OQ-20) | 404 `Service not found or not parsed` | Corrupt `parsed_data` → 500 `Corrupt parsed data`. Bad id → 400 | Browser download fails; Sabbath keeps any earlier cached file | `Error generating PPTX:` on 500. Cache write miss: `PPTX cache write/cleanup failed:` (`internal/httpapi`) |
| POST `/api/services/preview` | Plan build waits; no Service write (OQ-20) | 500 | No date / empty `raw_payload` → 400. Bad image URL → 400 | Preview pane empty or last good preview; form not saved | `Error generating preview:` (`internal/httpapi`) |

| ~~PUT `/api/services/[id]/song-sets`~~ (**never built** — the weekly inputs ride the Service mutation instead: `internal/httpapi/services.go:207` upserts `song_set_inputs` inside the create/update path, so AD-6's precondition is the Service's own `updated_at` and there is no second token. The row is kept because this design predicted a separate endpoint and the build chose otherwise) | Timeout; retry may double-apply an upsert (idempotent by `(service_id, variable_name)` PK) | 500 | Unknown `variableName` written anyway (inert row, AD-19/AD-31 posture) — no 400 for that case; same posture for a `songBookCode` naming a book no longer in `song_books` (written anyway, inert, resolved at render time per `05-model/form-fields.md`); bad song number format → 400 | Form: song/book/background stays as last saved on failure | `Error updating song set inputs:` (proposed logging site) |
| POST `/api/services/[id]/song-sets/[variableName]/save-to-book` (**as-built**, platform row 67; `internal/httpapi/server.go:41`. Its precondition held: the AD-36 bootstrap-once path landed first) | Timeout; a successful write already landed in `hymns` | 500 | Hymn moved under the Operator → 409 (SCN-4); no resolvable hymn → 400 | Editor shows the conflict or the failure; the Service's own override is unaffected either way | `Error saving lyric to song book:` (proposed logging site) |

| PUT `/api/admin/settings` | Timeout | 500 | Unknown transition / locale → 400; `pptx_retention_days` present and not a non-negative integer → 400; not Admin → 403. Keys written: `pptx_retention_days`, `slide_transition`, `ui_locale` | Previous settings remain | `Error updating settings:` (`internal/httpapi`) |
| POST `/api/webhook` | Timeout is on picoclaw; Hub does not retry | Secret unset → 503. Agent down: Hub silent | Wrong secret → 401 (secret not logged). Bad JSON → 400. Specified: no date → no row (OQ-21); images attach or fail visibly (OQ-22) | CAP-11 later: Events get no read-back. Operator sees Hub. Not this phase's handover | `Error processing webhook:` on 500 (`internal/httpapi`). Does not log the secret |
| `/login` | Waits on POST login | Login API 500 → form error | Wrong credentials → same 401 copy | Login form; never Hub | none on the page (client shows the API body) |
| `/` | List fetch waits on the API | Uncaught DB throw → framework error page | Corrupt `parsed_data` still listed by date | Dated list, or error page — not a silent empty Hub | none in `spa/src/pages/ServicesListPage.tsx`; API list logs as above if the client refetch fails |

## Robustness Analysis · [deep]

`critical` UCs only. Objects are not repeated in the SRS.

| UC | Boundary in | Control | Entity | Boundary out |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UC-1 | LC-8 webhook — later CAP-11 | LC-12 | Service, Hymn | JSON to picoclaw |
| UC-2 | `/services/new` + LC-2 POST — this phase | LC-12 | Service | Hub list |
| UC-5 | Run-Sheet + LC-2 PUT | LC-12 | Service | 200 or 409; 404 if gone (OQ-23) |
| UC-7 | LC-2 DELETE | LC-12 | Service → absent; local files unreferenced | list without the row |
| UC-17 | LC-8 `correct` — later CAP-11; named date, no nearest-Sabbath fallback (OQ-21) | LC-12 | Service | read-back |
| UC-28 | Service form lyric editor + LC-2 PUT (override) / LC-2 save-to-book (proposed, designed — closed by DEC-005/AD-36) | LC-12, LC-16 (resolution order) | Service (`song_set_inputs`), Hymn (`hymns.lyrics` on save-to-book only) | Deck reads the override (this Service) or the corrected book (future Services) |

`01-ux/` is not written: the owner skipped `wdi-ux`. Contracts: `02-contracts/`. Integration: picoclaw. Risky technical flows: `06-flows/webhook-intake.md`, `delete-service.md`, `lyric-save-to-book.md` (designed; the AD-25 conflict is closed by DEC-005/AD-36 — the remaining gate is build-order, not policy).

## Slots

`01-ux/` is not written — belongs to `wdi-ux`, skipped. `02-contracts/` (00-inventory + 01–08; `03-announcements.md` retired in place, not deleted). `03-integrations/picoclaw.md`. `04-components/` LC-12, LC-13, LC-16. `05-model/data-model.md`, `form-fields.md`. `06-flows/webhook-intake.md`, `delete-service.md`, `lyric-save-to-book.md` (new; designed, gated only on the AD-36 bootstrap-once migration landing first).

## Open Items

OQ-17 · OQ-2 · OQ-4. OQ-6 answered (DEC-003). OQ-1 is parked on CAP-11. Taken and encoded: OQ-20 · OQ-21 · OQ-22 · OQ-23. Parked on this SDD: OQ-27 (CAP-11 `[MISSING]` stay; not `BUG-` this wave). OQ-33 and OQ-34 retire with `03-announcements.md` — there is no announcement PUT/PATCH left to be non-idempotent about.

**New from this pass (DEC-004 G4), routed rather than answered here:**

- **AD-25 vs. FR-34/UC-28/BR-7** — closed by **DEC-005 / AD-36** (2026-08-20) and **both halves have
  shipped** (2026-08-22): the bootstrap-once path landed first, as this item required, then the
  save-to-book route. Nothing is open here. One caution earned the hard way: AD-36's rule covers the
  `song_books` registry row as well as `hymns`, and an every-boot reconcile of that row shipped and had
  to be replaced by a numbered migration the same day. Quote the rule; do not paraphrase it.
- **Endpoint numbering** — closed. `wdi-blueprint` refreshed the platform inventories from code on
  2026-08-22 (`0b24d5e`); save-to-book is row 67 and the separate Song Set PUT was never built.
- **`default_song_book` setting's home** — not decided in this pass (`02-contracts/07-settings.md`).
- **Unlink-on-delete must widen to check Registry-side references** before the delete cascade above ships, or a shared image could be removed out from under an Announcement Set (`06-flows/delete-service.md` Guarantees).
