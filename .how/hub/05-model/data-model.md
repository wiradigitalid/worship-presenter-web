# Model — Hub (physical)

Source: `src/lib/db/index.ts` startup DDL. [verified] plus one planned table below (DEC-004, not yet
in the DDL — [MISSING], see Invariants).

```mermaid

  accounts ||--o{ login_attempts : "ledger"
  accounts ||--o{ revoked_sessions : "sid"
  services ||--o{ song_set_inputs : "weekly + lyric override"
  settings }o--|| settings : "kv"
```

## Entities

| Entity | Table | Identified by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service | `services` | `id` |
| Song Set Weekly Input / Lyric Override | `song_set_inputs` (planned, DEC-004) | `(service_id, variable_name)` |
| Account | `accounts` | `id` / `username` |
| AppSetting | `settings` | `key` |
| Hymn (corpus) | `hymns` | `(book_code, number)` |

**`AnnouncementItem` / `announcement_items` is retired from Hub's domain (DEC-004, FR-3 retired).**
The table's physical fate is a build-time decision, not decided here — see *Retirement of
`announcement_items`* below; it MUST NOT be dropped before the residual-reuse caution in that section
is satisfied.

## Relationships

One Service has zero or many uploads in the JSON payload and zero or one `song_set_inputs` row per
Song Set entry the Registry currently defines (`variable_name` is a soft reference — no `FOREIGN KEY`
to a Registry table, since the entry list is Registry-owned data in a different table family;
`ON DELETE CASCADE` still applies to `service_id`). One Account one role.

| hymns | book_code | TEXT | Book key (AD-26) |
| hymns | number | INTEGER | Number in that book |
| hymns | title | TEXT | Hymn title in the Song Book |
| hymns | lyrics | TEXT | Verse/refrain lyrics; the "Save to Song Book" action (UC-28) is the only planned write path here besides the bootstrap-once loader — see *Migration* below (AD-36) |
| song_set_inputs (planned) | service_id | INTEGER, FK → services.id ON DELETE CASCADE | Owning Service |
| song_set_inputs (planned) | variable_name | TEXT | Which Song Set entry this row is for (Registry-owned identity, DEC-004 Supplement S2); soft reference, not a DB foreign key |
| song_set_inputs (planned) | song_number | INTEGER NULL | This week's hymn number for the entry (FR-32) |
| song_set_inputs (planned) | song_book_code | TEXT NULL | This week's Song Book choice; null falls back to `settings.default_song_book` (Supplement S3) |
| song_set_inputs (planned) | background_id | TEXT NULL | This week's Verse/Reff background choice from the Background Library; null falls back to the Admin global default (Supplement S4); never the **live** override, which AD-34 keeps unpersisted |
| song_set_inputs (planned) | lyric_override | TEXT NULL | This Service's edited lyric text (FR-34); null = untouched, falls through to `hymns.lyrics` (BR-7) |

## Invariants

- `UNIQUE(book_code, number)`
- `PRIMARY KEY (service_id, variable_name)` on `song_set_inputs` (planned) — one row per entry per Service, upsert not insert
- Deleting a Service cascades `song_set_inputs` (planned) — same `ON DELETE CASCADE` shape as the retired `announcement_items.service_id`
- Schema only through startup DDL (AD-9); `song_set_inputs` is a **numbered migration** (AD-21), never a reseed (AD-17) — existing Services get empty rows, not a synthetic backfill, except the one Family/Youth/song-number JSON-key migration named below, which is a normalize-on-read change to the *contents* of `parsed_data`, not a schema migration

## Migration — `song_set_inputs` (new table, DEC-004 / FR-32 / FR-34)

`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS song_set_inputs` per the dictionary above, at the next startup-DDL
version (AD-9, AD-21). **Assumption (smallest reasonable choice, not owner-confirmed):** existing
Services' four positional hymn overlays (`song1Number`..`song4Number`, embedded today as `hymn` items
in `parsed_data.items` rather than a named column — see `worship-form-fields.ts`) are, on this same
migration, copied one-time into four rows keyed by the seed's default `variable_name`s
(`opening_song_bt`, `closing_song_bt`, `opening_song_dw`, `closing_song_dw` — DEC-004 Supplement S2's
named default seed). If the Registry has not seeded those exact four names by the time this migration
runs, the copy is a no-op and existing Services simply start with no Song Set Weekly Input rows — never
a crash, per AD-17's fail-closed posture for a gap in existing data.

## Migration — Family/Youth split and Scripture/Theme (DEC-004 Supplement S1)

`parsed_data` is a schemaless JSON blob (`services.parsed_data TEXT`) — the precedent for evolving its
shape is already **normalize-on-read**, not a DDL migration: `normalizeParsedRundown()` already carries
the legacy combined `familyYouth` text forward into `familyPrayerRequest` when the split fields are
empty. The same pattern extends here, not a new mechanism:

- `familyYouth` (legacy combined) → `family_request` (renamed target of `familyPrayerRequest`) as-is,
  exactly once, the first time a row is read after this change ships; `family_name` starts empty (no
  source value ever existed for it — DEC-004 Supplement S1).
- `youthPrayerRequest` renames to `youth_request` the same way; `youth_name` starts empty.
- `scripture_bible_version` is **not** a new key to invent — it already exists as-built,
  `verseReading.translation` (`ParsedScripture.translation` / form field `verseTranslation`). DEC-004
  Supplement S1 calls it new; that claim does not match the code read for this SDD (`src/lib/parsed-fields.ts`
  `coerceScripture`, `src/lib/worship-form-fields.ts` `verseTranslation`) and is corrected here rather
  than repeated. Only the catalog **key name** changes (`verseTranslation` → `scripture_bible_version`
  as the Predefined Field token), not the underlying field.
- `theme_reference` / `theme_text` are already independent of `scripture_reference` / `scripture_text`
  as-built (`parsed.themeVerse` is its own `ParsedScripture`, separate from `parsed.verseReading`) — no
  migration needed there; DEC-004's "split" language describes work already done.

## Retirement of `announcement_items`

Hub's write paths onto this table retire with FR-3 (contract: `02-contracts/03-announcements.md`).
**The table itself MUST NOT be dropped in the same change that retires the API.** The residual
responsibility DEC-004 calls out — weekly image *asset reuse* must survive — sits entirely with the
**image files on disk** (`/api/uploads/<32-hex>.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp)`, AD-8), not with this table's
rows: those files are unaffected by anything here, and the Registry's Announcement Set canvases can
reference the same URLs directly (an image Predefined Field / manual image element pointing at an
existing upload) with no re-upload. What the table's rows carried — which flyer belonged to which
week, in what order — has no automatic transform into Registry Announcement Sets; an Admin re-authors
that structure by hand in the Registry, optionally picking the same already-uploaded image. Once that
one-time re-authoring is done and confirmed, a later numbered migration (AD-21) may drop the table;
until then it is dead but harmless, and Hub's delete-Service cascade (`06-flows/delete-service.md`)
must stop touching it the moment the API retires, so a deleted Service does not silently remove rows
an Admin has not yet migrated off of.

## Resolved — AD-25 vs. "Save to Song Book" (FR-34, UC-28), closed by DEC-005 / AD-36

AD-25 used to state there was **no** administrator or operator write path into a corpus table, and
that adding one "reopens this decision before it ships." DEC-004 Supplement S12 requires exactly that
write path into `hymns.lyrics`. This conflict is now closed: the owner ratified (2026-08-20) that the
song book becomes administrator-owned data after a one-time bootstrap, recorded in **DEC-005** and
landed as the living rule **AD-36**, which supersedes AD-25 in part — the song-book half only. The
bible family (`bible_verses`, `bible_books`, `bible_translations`, `bible_book_names`) stays fully
under AD-25, unaffected.

**Consequence for this table.** `hymns` is no longer a projection of `data/song-book/*.json` once a
book's rows have been bootstrapped: `upsertHymns` must become insert-only-for-absent-rows, gated by a
per-book-code marker (AD-36), so the `save-to-book` write survives a restart instead of being
overwritten by the next boot's reconcile. Build MUST land that bootstrap-once change in the same
numbered `data_version` migration (AD-21) that ships the `save-to-book` route — see
`06-flows/lyric-save-to-book.md` § *Migration* for the exact step. Until that migration lands, the
route MUST NOT ship: shipping the write path first, with the old unconditional reconcile still
running, would silently discard the Operator's correction on the very next restart.

## Physical notes

One SQLite file `DB_PATH`, WAL, `busy_timeout` 5000, FK on. Not a separate container.
