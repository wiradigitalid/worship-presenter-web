/**
 * Shared chrome for every operator page.
 *
 * Mounted as a React Router layout route (`<Route element={<OperatorShell />}>`)
 * so Header and the page shell survive navigation between operator pages. Only
 * `<Outlet />` (the page content) re-renders on a route change.
 *
 * Session is read from context, so this component renders nothing until the
 * SessionProvider resolves. That is a single shared fetch across the whole
 * tree; pages no longer gate on session themselves.
 *
 * `NavigationBlockerProvider` is mounted here — the narrowest layout covering
 * both of its consumers: Header (above) reads `isBlocked` to decide whether to
 * confirm a navigation, and the artifact editor (below via `<Outlet />`) writes
 * it when its canvas is dirty. Pages that do not touch it read the default
 * (`isBlocked: false`) and behave exactly as before.
 *
 * `innerClassName="max-w-6xl"` widens the default `max-w-5xl` because the
 * artifact editor's table wants the extra room. Other pages render their own
 * internal spacing (e.g. `<div className="space-y-8">`) inside this shell.
