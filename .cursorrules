# Agent Rules — worship-presenter-web

This repository is **public**. Congregation data never enters it. How to install and
update WDI Method lives in the marked block below — do not copy those instructions
into this intro; they would drift.

## Public repository

Full rule: `.constitution/project/public-repository.md`. Before **every** `git commit` and **every** `git push`:

1. Refuse to stage `.env*`, `data/local/`, `data/uploads/`, `data.db*`, `slides*/`, `*.pptx` /
   `*.potx`, or any real congregation / payment / production-host data.
2. Run `node --import ./tests/register-ts-resolve.mjs --test --experimental-strip-types tests/public-repo-guard.test.mjs`
   (or `npm test`).
3. On failure, fix the tracked content. Never weaken the guard.

Never commit real names, photographs, prayer requests, phones, addresses, bank accounts, payment QR
codes, uploaded flyers, rendered slides, or source decks. Example content uses a **synthetic
congregation**. Invent a name — do not reach for a real member's. Real data lives in
`data/local/default-registry.json` (gitignored). The legacy repo `bic-pptx-workflow` is frozen.

<!-- BEGIN:wdi-method -->
This repo uses **WDI Method**. It wraps BMad; it does not replace it. This marked
block is owned by the WDI Method package and is **replaced on every update**.
Product rules belong **outside** it (extra boundaries, `## Code`, stack notes).
A fact written inside this block will be overwritten.

Product identity lives in `.control/registry/index.yaml` (`product.name`, optional
`product.client`). G1 confirms it. This file MUST NOT become a second source of the name.

## Install and update

BMad first, then WDI Method. In the product repo:

```bash
npx bmad-method install
npx wdi-method
```

No subcommand opens the installer TUI. It detects an existing install and offers
**update**. Non-interactive:

```bash
npx wdi-method install --yes
npx wdi-method update --yes
```

BMad: https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD
WDI Method: https://github.com/wiradigitalid/wdi-method

A method file MUST NOT be invented here. If a rule is wrong, fix it in the WDI
Method package, then update.

This file is loaded every session; everything else is loaded **lazily**, only when
the task matches.

## Language

**Two settings decide this, and they live in `.control/registry/index.yaml` under `policy:`.** Both are
free text and both default to English:

| Setting | Governs |
|---|---|
| `doc_language` | The prose of working documents in `.what/` · `.how/` · `.control/` |
| `doc_filename_language` | The slug part of a document filename |

Read those two before writing a document. A technical term the industry writes in English MUST be left in
English whatever the setting says — an equivalent MUST NOT be invented for it.

**These files are always English, whatever the settings say:** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and everything
under `.constitution/`. They are agent instructions, and they travel to every repo through the
`wdi-method` package. The one exception is `.constitution/project/`, which is this product's own room.

**Always English and never a setting**, because a script matches them:

- method terminology — `DEC` `SRS` `SDD` `UC` `FR` `AD`, the gate names, the values of `mode` and
  `risk_accepted`
- document code prefixes — `UC-` `DEC-` `SRS-`; only the slug after them follows `doc_filename_language`
- markers — `[NEEDS CONFIRMATION]` `[MISSING]` `[ASSUMED]` `[PARTIAL]`, and `yes`/`no` in a `critical`
  column
- registry values — `mode: catalog`, `status: applied`, `risk_accepted: low`. Used as written in prose
  too: one thing, one name
- code identifiers, database columns, config keys — `language-guide.md` owns these

**A corpus written before these settings existed MUST NOT be migrated for them.** The readers accept more
than one language, so existing documents keep working and only new writing follows the setting.

## The thing in your hand → its folder

Read this instead of reasoning about what `.what/` and `.how/` mean.

| The thing in your hand | Its folder |
|---|---|
| A rule, a guide, a template — how we work | `.constitution/method/` — **overwritten in full by `update`** |
| A rule that binds **only this product** | `.constitution/project/` — `update` never writes over it, `promote` never publishes it |
| The explanation of a rule, never a rule itself | `.constitution/method/why/` |
| A decision, an open question, a registry, a structure map, minutes | `.control/` |
| The brief, a PRD, a use case, a business rule — what is promised | `.what/` |
| The spine, C4, an inventory, an SDD, a contract — how it is built | `.how/` |
| A skill run's working output, and documents that predate the method | `_bmad-output/` |
| Scratch that empties when the task closes | `.work/` |
| The application | named under `## Code` below |

## Layer boundaries

| Layer | Answers | MUST NOT hold |
|---|---|---|
| `.constitution/` | How we work | State, decisions, product content |
| `.control/` | What currently holds and what has been decided | Rules |
| `.what/` | What is promised | Solution shape — tables, endpoints, technology |
| `.how/` | How it is built | Promises to the user |
| `_bmad-output/` | Work in progress; committed, not curated | Anything still correct after its wave has passed |
| `.work/` | Scratch; emptied when a task closes | Secrets, commercial figures, anything meant as authority |

The placement test: **is this file still correct after its wave has passed?** Yes → the corpus. No →
`_bmad-output/`. In doubt → `.constitution/method/document/corpus-guide.md`.

The method does not use a `docs/` layer for corpus or rules. A leftover `docs/` folder is inventory
to sort, not a second home.

## Depth and review intensity — two fields, never merged

| Field | Where | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `index.yaml` globally, `components.yaml` per component | **Document depth**, and only that. `catalog` · `outline` · `guarded` · `deep`; default `catalog` |
| `risk_accepted` | `components.yaml` per component | **Review intensity**, and only that. `low` · `medium` · `high` |

Per-component `mode` wins over global, and there is no third scope — `mode` MUST NOT be overridden per
wave or per `SPEC.md`. A component at `mode: catalog` **skips G4 entirely**. Neither field MUST be
derived from the other: one component MAY be thin on purpose and reviewed the hardest.
`.constitution/method/document/delivery-flow-guide.md` owns both;
`.constitution/method/why/rationale.md` says why they are separate.

## The five gates and the fifteen skills

| Gate | Decides | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| **G1 Problem** | What the problem is, whose it is, why it earns work | `wdi-problem` |
| **G2 Product** | What is built, and how it feels to use | `wdi-product` · optional `wdi-ux` |
| **G3 Blueprint** | The whole portrait, once per product | `wdi-blueprint` |
| **G4 Component** | How one component is built — **skipped at `catalog`** | `wdi-component` |
| **G5 Release** | Whether it is done and proven | `wdi-build` |

Before G1 and at the tail of G2: `wdi-init`, five intents — `setup` · `component` · `mode` · `risk` ·
`structure`.

Any time: `wdi-decision` · `wdi-question` · `wdi-log` · `wdi-help` · `wdi-reconcile` · `wdi-review` ·
`wdi-report` · `wdi-systematic-debugging`.

**No BMad skill is invoked directly.** Each has a wrapper, and the wrapper is what checks position,
verifies the result, and lands the memlog.

## What MUST NOT be done

- A method file MUST NOT be invented or patched here to improve the method. If a rule is wrong, it is
  fixed in the WDI Method package, then brought here with `npx wdi-method update`.
- A file in `_bmad-output/prior-knowledge/` MUST NOT be copied into `.what/` or `.how/`. It enters
  the corpus only through the skill that owns the slot.
- `.control/generated/` MUST NOT be written by hand — it is the output of `validate.py` and
  `timeline.py`.
- The two structure maps in `.control/` MUST NOT be edited by hand — `wdi-init` intent `structure`
  re-derives them.
- A `DEC-` with status `applied` MUST NOT be edited, except to record its supersession — status moves
  to `superseded` and names its replacement. A change of mind produces a new `DEC-`.
- A file in `.constitution/method/why/` MUST NOT be cited as the reason to reject a change. It is
  `status: Reference` — it explains, it does not bind, and where it disagrees with a guide the guide
  wins and the disagreement is a defect. This covers `why/` ONLY: a guide in
  `.constitution/method/document/` is `status: Accepted` and it binds.
- More than the component's `mode` demands MUST NOT be written. Exceeding the depth the owner set is
  not diligence.
- `.claude/skills/bmad-*/customize.toml` MUST NOT be edited — it is overwritten on every BMad update;
  customise through `_bmad/custom/`.

## Routing — load a guide when the task matches

| Task | Load |
|---|---|
| Wanting the whole method in five minutes | `.constitution/method/why/README.md` |
| About to change a rule, and needing to know what breaks | `.constitution/method/why/rationale.md` |
| Asking whether a document exists at this `mode`, or where a file goes | `.constitution/method/why/artifact-map.md` |
| Unsure whether a file may exist in this repo | `.constitution/method/repo-guide.md` |
| Unsure where a file lives | `.constitution/method/document/corpus-guide.md` |
| Unsure what a method term means | `.constitution/method/method-glossary.md` |
| Unsure about a domain term | `.control/product-glossary.md` |
| Looking for a non-technical fact — a domain, an account, a legal entity, a locked date | `.control/project-non-technical-log.md` |
| Naming anything — a code identifier, a file, a database column | `.constitution/method/language-guide.md` |
| Asking "which gate now, what next" | `.constitution/method/document/delivery-flow-guide.md` · skill `wdi-help` |
| Setting or changing `mode` or `risk_accepted` | `.constitution/method/document/delivery-flow-guide.md` · skill `wdi-init` |
| Invoking a BMad skill | `.constitution/method/document/bmad-guide.md` · `.constitution/method/document/bmad-skill-register.md` |
| Writing or reviewing a product brief | `.constitution/method/document/brief-guide.md` |
| Writing or reviewing a PRD | `.constitution/method/document/prd-guide.md` |
| Writing or reviewing UX | `.constitution/method/document/ux-guide.md` |
| Writing or reviewing an SRS | `.constitution/method/document/srs-guide.md` |
| Writing or reviewing an SDD | `.constitution/method/document/sdd-guide.md` |
| Writing the spine, an `AD-N`, C4, or one of the three inventories | `.constitution/method/document/architecture-guide.md` |
| Opening, accepting, or applying a `DEC-` | `.constitution/method/document/decision-guide.md` |
| Writing or reading a structure map | `.constitution/method/structure-guide.md` |
| Looking for where code lives, or placing new code | `.control/structure-codebase.md` |
| Looking for where a document lives | `.control/structure-document.md` |
| Writing or reviewing code | `.constitution/project/codebase-stack-guide.md` · `.constitution/project/codebase-conventions-guide.md` · `.constitution/project/codebase-brownfield-guide.md` |

All three `.constitution/project/codebase-*-guide.md` start as `status: Draft`. While they are, their contents MAY be read
as guidance but MUST NOT be used to reject a change.

The two structure maps MUST NOT be installed as `doc_standards` — they are facts, not standards. Nor
MUST anything in `.constitution/method/why/`; `status: Reference` forbids it. A guide in
`.constitution/method/document/` MAY be installed that way, and several already are — see
`_bmad/custom/bmad-prd.toml`.

## Bugs, decisions, questions

- A bug, a failing test, or unexpected behaviour → skill `wdi-systematic-debugging`, **before** any
  fix is proposed.
- A decision worth remembering → skill `wdi-decision` → `.control/decisions/`. Recording is **not
  mandatory**: if the answer to *why is it like this* is readable from the code, it MUST NOT be
  recorded. One case is mandatory — contradicting an `AD-N`.
- Something that cannot be decided now → skill `wdi-question` → `.control/questions/`. The default
  class is `assumptions.md`, not `blocking.md`; filing something as blocking "to be safe" is the
  habit that produced unreadable question lists.
- A non-technical fact that constrains the build → skill `wdi-log` intent `fact` →
  `.control/project-non-technical-log.md`.

## Method policy

- A skill MUST NOT be invoked automatically. Name the one that fits and wait for the owner's
  go-ahead — this holds even when the skill's own description says it must be used. Reading a
  skill as reference is fine.
- `.work/` is not production code. It MUST NOT be imported by the application, and MUST be
  excluded when searching for code.
<!-- END:wdi-method -->

## Code

Go API in `cmd/` and `internal/`. React SPA in `spa/` (Vite). Shared UI modules
and the PPTX worker live in `src/`. Package versions: `package.json`. The three
`.constitution/project/codebase-*-guide.md` files are protected at every `status:`.
While `Draft`, they MAY be read as guidance and MUST NOT reject a change.

A test that asserts something is **absent** is worth nothing until it has been seen to fail. Prove
every new or changed absence-guard by injecting the defect, then reverting. Inject every form the
guard claims to cover. Do not narrow a guard to silence a false positive without re-proving it.

## Policy

- A skill MUST NOT be invoked automatically. Name the one that fits and wait for the owner's
  go-ahead. Reading a skill as reference is fine.
- `.work/` is committed scratch, emptied when a task closes. It MUST NOT be imported by `src/`,
  MUST be excluded when searching for code, and MUST stay out of deploy payloads.
  Congregation data MUST NOT land there.

## Sync rule for this file

`CLAUDE.md` MUST remain `@AGENTS.md`. `.agents/AGENTS.md` and `.cursorrules` MUST be identical to
this file.
