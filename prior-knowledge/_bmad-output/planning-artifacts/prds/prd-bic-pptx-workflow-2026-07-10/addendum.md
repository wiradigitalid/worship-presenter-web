## 2. Lyric slide construction rules (FR-5 source)

- Each **verse** starts on a new slide. If one verse is too much for one slide, it divides across more than one slide.
- Each **Reff** (refrain) starts on a new slide. If one Reff is too much for one slide, it divides across more than one slide.
- Slide count per song depends on: verse count, availability of a Reff (some songs have none), and readability of verses/Reff that may split across slides.
- Labels: `n/total` for verses, `Reff` for refrain; when a Reff exists it repeats after each verse.

## 3. Announcement List mechanics (FR-3 source)

- Announcements are **images only**; MP4/video upload is out of scope entirely.
- Some announcements **recur** week to week; the app keeps a persistent ordered Announcement List.
- picoclaw (or an Operator in the Web Hub) instructs per week: which items **stay**, which are **replaced**, which are **removed**, which **one-off** items are added for that Service only, and the **order**.
- **Image binding & order** come from the sender's **textual description** accompanying the images (sent in sequence): picoclaw reads the description to assign each image to its role (sermon graphic, family/youth photo, announcement flyers) and to order the list. Unresolvable or missing images are flagged for the Reviewer, not silently dropped or rendered as a broken placeholder (a broken family-photo placeholder is visible on source slide 56).
- Flyer bursts (e.g., slides 58–65 mission-trip report) are the exception, not the weekly rule — an empty list is a normal week.

## 4. API surface implied by the PRD (architecture input, not contract)

- **Service input API** — accepts the Weekly Data Payload; **validates SDAH Numbers against the Song Book and resolves lyrics server-side in the same call**; returns per-item validity so picoclaw can inform the sender (FR-2). picoclaw never resolves lyrics itself.
- **Service list/detail API, queryable by text** — lets picoclaw find and confirm a target Service for corrections (FR-8, used by FR-12 in Phase 3; default proposal = nearest upcoming Sabbath, explicit date honored, always confirm before applying).
- **Announcement List API** — keep/replace/remove/add-one-off + ordering (FR-3).
- **Image upload** — posters, sermon graphic, family/youth photo (FR-3/FR-6). Telegram path: images arrive as an ordered sequence plus the sender's textual description; picoclaw binds each image to its role and order from that description. Hub path: Operators may also `POST /api/upload`; stored refs are `/api/uploads/<32-hex>.<ext>` under `UPLOADS_DIR`. The save response echoes what was stored — including resolved Hymn titles — for sender verification (FR-1/FR-2).

## 5. Retention & regeneration notes (FR-10b source)

- Auto-cleanup deletes **only generated PPTX** files past the Admin-configured window. Worship rows, participant text, posters, and all other data persist — manual delete only.
- Post-cleanup regeneration rebuilds from stored payload + assets; the output need **not** be byte-identical to the originally generated file.

## 6. Web Slideshow offline scope (FR-15 source)

- Online required for initial load; afterwards the loaded show runs without connection.
- Cache depth: **one Sabbath worship — one Service's deck** (not a library).
- Offline data operations may surface a connection error; the PPTX remains the hard offline guarantee.

## 7. Scripture Display placement (FR-19 source)

- KJV-only Verse Database (developer-provided).
- Invoked **inside Presenter Mode**, not a separate app screen: look up by reference, push to projector output, dismiss to return to the Deck. Never touches the Deck or payload.

## 8. Phase rationale (user directive, 2026-07-11)

Phase 1 is the only chased target: deliverables must be immediately usable — narrow scope so value lands at once. Phases 2–6 (slideshow, Telegram corrections, retention, presenter mode, scripture display) are nice-to-have and are built **only if Phase 1 proves useful** in real weekly service.
