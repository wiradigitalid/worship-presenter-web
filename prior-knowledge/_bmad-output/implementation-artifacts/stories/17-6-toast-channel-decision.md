# Story 17.6: The Toast Channel Two Documents Describe Does Not Exist

Status: done

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As an operator completing an action,
I want the transient confirmation channel this product's design documents describe to be **decided, dated and owned** rather than described as shipped,
so that no artifact in this repository promises a channel that cannot fire, and the story that wires it knows exactly what rule it is wiring.

## The decision this story encodes — ratified, not open

**The owner ratified this on 2026-08-05. It is not a question this story asks, and it must not be re-opened, re-litigated, or offered back for confirmation. Encode it.**

> "Yes to a COMBINED inline + toast design, ratified as a written rule NOW; the wiring is built LATER, after Story 17.7 creates the operator-vs-room-facing route group."

The epic block for this story said, before this story's own rewrite of it, *"The story's first job is a decision, not an implementation"*, and listed the delete-two-rows-and-uninstall branch as the smaller option. **That branch was declined.** The answer is *yes, a transient channel — under a rule*, and this story is that answer written down; `epics.md`'s block (`:322-331`) now records the outcome rather than the question it once posed.

**Nothing here is a discovery.** The rule's third clause is already the second sentence of the shipped `sonner` row in `EXPERIENCE.md`: *"Never the sole channel for an error that blocks work."* The combined inline + toast design is what these documents have described all along. What was missing was never the design — it was the wiring, and a rule stating when each channel applies. Say so in the artifacts: this story ratifies what the documents already implied and withdraws only the false claim that it is *shipped*.

## Scope: documentation and registration only

**Five files for this story's own work. AC-9's `bmad-architecture` Update run adds its own artifacts on top of those five, and that is not a sixth file for this story to avoid — see the note below the table.**

| File | What changes |
| --- | --- |
| `.../ux-designs/ux-bic-pptx-workflow-2026-07-10/EXPERIENCE.md` | The rule (new dated decision block under *Component Patterns*); the `sonner` row (`:122`); Open Item 4 (`:330`) |
| `.../ux-designs/ux-bic-pptx-workflow-2026-07-10/DESIGN.md` | The `sonner` row in *Components* (`:207`) |
| `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` | Story 17.6's own block (`:322-331`); Epic 17's status line (`:280`); a new Story 17.9 block after 17.8 |
| `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` | New `17-9-toast-channel-wiring` row; `last_updated`; this story's row |
| This story file | Dev Agent Record on completion |

**Why the working tree can legitimately hold more than these five plus the story, and why that is not scope creep.** AC-9 requires a `bmad-architecture` Update run to repair the stale `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:464` bullet — that run owns `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md` itself, never this story's hand, and it carries its own working record alongside it: `deferred-work.md` (this project's stated home for a finding an architecture run surfaces but does not patch — see `AGENTS.md`), `architecture/.memlog.md` (a tracked working memlog kept across runs, not a per-story artifact), and dated files under `architecture/reviews/` (a tracked directory that already carried 26 prior runs' review files before this one added its own). None of those five is this story's file to write, and none of them is out of scope for the change set this coordinator is landing as a whole — they are the Update run's own legitimate artifacts, filed under the same authority map that reserves the spine for that run rather than for this one. An earlier "six files" framing of this story's scope predated the Update run's existence and should be read as this story's own five plus the story file, not as a ceiling on everything the coordinated change set may touch.

**This story ships NO new UI surface.** Explicitly out of scope, and each of these is a way to fail this story:

- **No file under `src/` is touched.** Not one.
- **No file under `tests/` is touched.** No test added, removed, edited, or re-registered in `package.json` `scripts.test`.
- **`sonner` is not uninstalled.** `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are untouched. (Never hand-edit `package-lock.json` — `tests/lockfile-integrity.test.mjs` exists because a text-level rewrite once broke `npm ci` repo-wide for two days.)
- **`src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` is not deleted.** Deleting it breaks a shipped assertion — `tests/theme-chrome.test.mjs:2025-2034` reads that file for `useTheme()` and for the absence of `ThemeProvider`. Story 17.1's AC-5 rests on it.
- **No `<Toaster />` is mounted** in any layout or page.
- **No `toast(` call is added** anywhere.
- **`ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md` is not edited by this story.** See *The one spine repair* below — it is real, it is blocking, and it is not yours to make.

## Why the wiring cannot land now

This is the story's technical rationale and it belongs in the artifacts, not only here. All four points were re-verified in this worktree on 2026-08-05.

**1. There is exactly one layout, and every route inherits it.** `find src/app -name layout.tsx` returns one file: `src/app/layout.tsx`. There is no `template.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `loading.tsx` or `not-found.tsx` anywhere under `src/app`. Both room-facing screens inherit that single root — `src/app/services/[id]/present/projector/page.tsx` and `src/app/services/[id]/slideshow/page.tsx`. **So mounting `<Toaster />` in the only layout available today renders toasts on the congregation's screen during a service.**

**2. And that toast would follow the operator's theme while it was there.** `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx:31-38` sets its own CSS variables from theme tokens — `--normal-bg: var(--popover)`, `--normal-text: var(--popover-foreground)`, `--normal-border: var(--border)`, `--border-radius: var(--radius)` — and `:7-8` calls `useTheme()`. That violates the Epic 17 preamble rule (`epics.md:284`): *"whatever an operator's theme, the projected output (`slide-surface`, PPTX, projector window) must be byte-identical. The congregation never sees operator chrome."* It is also exactly what the `PROJECTED` set in `tests/theme-chrome.test.mjs:595-606` exists to enforce.

**3. AD-24 already decides where the mount belongs, so this story applies an existing decision rather than making a new one.** `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:212` states the rule verbatim:

> "the client boundary mounts at the narrowest layout that covers its consumers, and never on `layout.tsx` itself… The test for a new provider is **decidable rather than a matter of taste — enumerate its consumers and mount at the narrowest layout that contains all of them.** Root is the answer only when that enumeration is *every route*, and 'it is simpler at the root' is not that enumeration."

**Operator routes only** is the ceiling AD-24's closure clause (`ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:213`) imposes on this enumeration, not a measurement performed today — `toast(` has zero call sites in `src/`, so there is nothing yet to enumerate; the projector and the slideshow are the room-facing set AD-24 forbids outright, which is what bounds the eventual answer to operator routes whenever a call site does appear. That ceiling is not *every route*, so AD-24 makes the root layout the wrong mount **decidably**, and makes an operator-scoped route-segment layout the right one. **That segment's existence is the real precondition, not a promise Story 17.7 has made:** 17.7's own registered contract is one route-group layout owning every *room-facing* URL — the room-facing half; if that split leaves the operator routes directly under `src/app`, `17-9-toast-channel-wiring` creates the operator-scoped segment itself rather than wiring into one 17.7 already built. **The dependency is therefore on that segment existing, whoever creates it — a consequence of a decision already in the spine, not a scheduling preference.**

**4. The per-page mount alternative was considered and rejected by the owner.** There are ten `page.tsx` files under `src/app`; two are room-facing, leaving **eight** operator-facing pages that would each need their own mount. That is the anti-pattern this project fought four review rounds over on Story 17.1 and then promoted to spine altitude — *"a rule applied too narrowly keeps being closed by widening the list rather than by encoding the rule"* (`epics.md:358`). The spine says the same thing about this exact move: *"Widening `FULL_SCREEN` to a route-group layout is the encoding, not list widening… What must be refused is adding another leaf file to any of the four lists"* (`ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:468`). **An operator-scoped route-segment layout is the encoding, whichever story ends up creating it. Eight leaf mounts is the list, and it stays the list regardless of who builds the segment.**

## Verified facts — re-verify before you restate any of them

Every row below was checked in this worktree on 2026-08-05. **This repo has paid for unverified citations in both directions** (`project-context.md`: *"A file:line citation you write in a doc is a claim, and it rots"*). Re-run these before writing them into an artifact.

| Claim | Command | Result 2026-08-05 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exactly one layout | `find src/app -name layout.tsx` | `src/app/layout.tsx` — one line |
| No other route shell | `find src/app -name "template.tsx" -o -name "error.tsx" -o -name "not-found.tsx" -o -name "loading.tsx"` | empty |
| `sonner` is a declared dependency | `git grep -n sonner package.json` | `"sonner": "^2.0.7"` (`:33`) |
| `Toaster` is exported | `git grep -n Toaster src/` | 4 hits, all in `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` (`:4`, `:7`, `:12`, `:49`) |
| `Toaster` is mounted nowhere | same command — no hit outside `sonner.tsx` | confirmed |
| `toast(` is called nowhere | `git grep -n "toast(" src/` | no output |
| Toasts paint from theme tokens | read `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx:31-38` | `var(--popover)`, `var(--popover-foreground)`, `var(--border)`, `var(--radius)` |
| Ten pages, two room-facing | `find src/app -name page.tsx` | 10 files; `slideshow/page.tsx` + `present/projector/page.tsx` are room-facing |
| Next free story key in Epic 17 | `git grep -nE "^  17-[0-9]" _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` | `17-1`..`17-8` taken (`17-8` is `done`); **`17-9` is free** |

**One more tree reference exists and is deliberately left alone.** `docs/component-inventory-monolith.md:107` names `Sonner` / `sonner.tsx` as a *"Toast message overlay utility."* That row catalogues a **file that exists** and asserts no shipped pattern, no operator-visible behaviour and no owner — so nothing in it becomes false when this story lands, and editing it would put a documentation change inside a `bmad-document-project` dump for no gain. Recorded here so the finding is **owned rather than lost**, which is this project's recurring failure mode.

## The rule to record

Three clauses. Record them **once**, in `EXPERIENCE.md`, as a dated decision block under *Component Patterns* — the section a reader lands in from the `sonner` row, and the section whose intro already says *"Behavioral contracts only"*. Everything else cites it; nothing else restates it.

**ONE EVENT, ONE CHANNEL.** An outcome is reported inline **or** by toast, never both. Double-reporting is noise, and an operator who learns that two channels always say the same thing learns to read neither.

**TOAST ONLY WHEN THE INLINE SURFACE IS GONE.** A toast is admissible only where the surface that would have carried the inline message is no longer on screen, or no longer in view, at the moment the outcome arrives — the action completing after a route change is the case that motivates it.

**TOAST IS NEVER THE SOLE CHANNEL FOR AN ERROR THAT BLOCKS WORK.** It self-dismisses, and assistive technology does not reliably announce it. **This clause is not new** — it is already the second sentence of the shipped `sonner` row, which is the evidence that the combined design was always what these documents described.

Phrasing is yours. The three clauses, the ratification date, the owner as its source, and the *stated once* property are not.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **The rule exists, once, as a dated decision, stated once among the artifacts that assert it as a shipped contract.** `EXPERIENCE.md` carries a named decision block under *Component Patterns* stating all three clauses, dated 2026-08-05 and attributed to the owner's ratification. **Verifiable:** the three clauses appear in exactly one place among the tracked artifacts that claim the rule as fact — `EXPERIENCE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `epics.md`, `sprint-status.yaml`; the `sonner` rows in both artifacts and Open Item 4 **cite** that block rather than restating any clause. **This property is precise, not violated, by this story's own *The rule to record* section (`:87-93`) below:** that section is the specification handed to the writer of what to encode, not a second artifact independently claiming the contract, so it is not counted against the *stated once* property — a spec of what to write is a different kind of object than a restatement of what has been written.

2. **`EXPERIENCE.md`'s `sonner` row is a decided-not-wired claim.** The row at `:122` no longer reads *"⚠ Specified, not shipped — Owner: Story 17.6."* It states that the channel rule is **ratified** and the wiring is **not built**, cites the rule block, and names the forward owner `17-9-toast-channel-wiring`. It still states the verified facts (`Toaster` mounted nowhere, `toast(` called nowhere) with the re-verification date. **Verifiable:** read the row; `git grep` finds no *"Specified, not shipped"* claim for `sonner`.

3. **`DESIGN.md`'s `sonner` row is a decided-not-wired claim.** The row in *Components* (`:207`) no longer reads *"⚠ Nothing renders it today … owner Story 17.6."* Same treatment as AC-2, with `DESIGN.md`'s own scope (visual role) preserved: shadcn default, unmodified, bottom-corner, greyscale, `destructive` only for failures, and it reads the theme correctly. The intro at `:188` still lists `sonner` among the five installed primitives — **that sentence stays true and must not change.** **Verifiable:** read the row.

4. **`EXPERIENCE.md` Open Item 4 is answered, not open.** The item at `:330` no longer poses *"whether transient confirmation is a channel this product wants at all"* as an open question and no longer describes the uninstall-and-delete branch as an available outcome. It records the ratified answer, the deferred wiring, the forward owner, and the technical reason the wiring waits on Story 17.7 (one root layout; the two room-facing routes inherit it; `sonner.tsx` paints from theme tokens; AD-24's narrowest-layout rule). It follows the list's own convention for an answered item, and the list's preamble rule — *"Each item names the story key that owns it"* — resolves. **Verifiable:** read the item; the key it names resolves under AC-6.

5. **No forward pointer names Story 17.6 as the owner of unfinished work.** After this story, `git grep -niE "owner: story 17\.6|owner Story 17\.6"` returns nothing, and every remaining mention of 17.6 in a tracked file is a **past-tense record** of the story that ratified the rule, not a pointer at pending work. Story 17.6 is closed; a pointer at it is a dead end. **Verifiable:** run the grep, then inspect each surviving `17.6` / `17-6` hit and confirm it is a record. (Its own key row in `sprint-status.yaml` and its own epic block are records, not pointers. `tests/theme-chrome.test.mjs:2022-2024` is also a record and stays untouched — every factual claim in that comment survives this story: `<Toaster />` is still mounted nowhere, `toast(` is still called nowhere, and 17.6 is still the story that owned the decision.)

6. **The forward owner resolves as a real story key in both tracking files, declared dependent on Story 17.7.** `17-9-toast-channel-wiring` appears (a) as a `#### Story 17.9:` block inside Epic 17 in `epics.md`, positioned after Story 17.8, carrying a user-story statement, the ratified rule as its contract, and an explicit statement that it depends on Story 17.7's route group; and (b) as `17-9-toast-channel-wiring: backlog` in `sprint-status.yaml`, positioned after `17-8-guard-criteria-encoding` and before `epic-17-retrospective`, with a comment recording why it exists, that it depends on 17.7, and that it was kept out of 17.7 deliberately. **Verifiable:** `git grep -n "17-9-toast-channel-wiring"` hits both tracking files plus every pointer written by AC-2, AC-3 and AC-4; the sprint-status status value is one of the documented set; `last_updated` reflects this change set.

7. **`epics.md` records this story's outcome rather than its question.** Story 17.6's block no longer presents the channel question as open and no longer describes deleting two rows and uninstalling a dependency as the likely outcome. It states the ratified decision, that the story produced a rule and shipped no surface, and the forward key. Epic 17's status line (`:280`) lists Story 17.9 in the correct status group. **Verifiable:** read both.

8. **Nothing is installed, uninstalled, mounted, called, or deleted.** `package.json` still declares `sonner: ^2.0.7`; `package-lock.json` is byte-identical; `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` still exists and still exports `Toaster`; `git grep -n Toaster src/` still returns hits only inside that file; `git grep -n "toast(" src/` still returns nothing; and `git status --porcelain` lists **no path under `src/`, `tests/`, `package.json` or `package-lock.json`**. **Verifiable:** run all five.

9. **The stale `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md` *Deferred* bullet is repaired in this change set, through a `bmad-architecture` Update run, and this story does not reach `done` until it lands.** The bullet at `:464` says the transient-channel question is *live*, that *"Story 17.6 is where it gets asked"*, that the answer may be *no*, and that it is tracked as `17-6-toast-channel-decision` (`backlog`). Closing this story falsifies all four. **The repair must achieve:** the question reads as **answered** rather than live; the answer is the combined design with the wiring deferred; the speculative *"no"* branch is **retracted**, because it is the branch the owner declined; the owner key moves from 17.6 to `17-9-toast-channel-wiring`; and the `(backlog)` status goes. **The Update run owns the wording — do not pre-write it.** **Verifiable:** the bullet no longer names 17.6 as a live owner; `git log` shows the Update run's change set alongside this one.

   **The dev agent must not edit `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md`.** `AGENTS.md` reserves spine changes for a `bmad-architecture` Update run, Story 17.1 was held open twice by the owner over exactly this, and two workflows in a row have already declined to substitute for that gate (`ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:218`). The Update run is pre-authorized for this session and is dispatched by the coordinator, so this is a named channel with an owner rather than a request filed into a queue — which is the failure mode this project keeps hitting.

10. **The suite is unchanged and green, and every citation this story writes resolves.** `npm test` passes. No file under `tests/` is added, removed or edited, and `package.json` `scripts.test` is unchanged — `tests/theme-chrome.test.mjs:2015` (*"AC-5: sonner reads the theme, and the provider sits above it"*) must still pass **unmodified**, which it does because `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` and the `<ThemeProvider>` in `src/app/layout.tsx` are untouched. Separately, every `file:line` citation written into an artifact by this story resolves to what it claims, and every artifact this change set edits is internally consistent when it is finished: both UX frontmatter `updated:` dates read `2026-08-05`, and `sprint-status.yaml`'s own header block is true about the state of the file it dates. **Verifiable:** `npm test`; `git status --porcelain`; open each citation; read the two frontmatter blocks and the sprint-status header.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 — Re-verify before writing anything (AC: 1-10)**
  - [x] Run every command in the *Verified facts* table and confirm each result. Do not copy this story's numbers on trust.
  - [x] Re-read the two rows to be rewritten (`EXPERIENCE.md:114`, `DESIGN.md:207`) and Open Item 4 (`EXPERIENCE.md:322`) in full — each carries context that must survive the rewrite. *(Repaired 2026-08-05, FIX round: those were this row's line numbers before Task 2 inserted the decision block above them; after that insertion they moved to `EXPERIENCE.md:122` and `:330`. This subtask's own citation is left dated deliberately — it records what was re-read before the file changed — and every citation written or moved after Task 2 is corrected below.)*
  - [x] Confirm `17-9` is still the next free key in Epic 17.

- [x] **Task 2 — Write the rule into `EXPERIENCE.md` (AC: 1)**
  - [x] Add a dated decision block under `## Component Patterns`, after the intro line and before the pattern table, as a `###` subsection (matching the file's existing `###` usage).
  - [x] State all three clauses, the 2026-08-05 date, and the owner as the source.
  - [x] State that the third clause is pre-existing — it is the shipped `sonner` row's second sentence — and that the combined design is what these documents already described; only the wiring was missing.
  - [x] Confirm no clause is restated anywhere else in the tracked tree.

- [x] **Task 3 — Rewrite the two component rows (AC: 2, 3)**
  - [x] `EXPERIENCE.md:122` (`:114` before Task 2's decision block shifted it) — decided-not-wired; cite the rule block; name `17-9-toast-channel-wiring`; keep the verified facts with their date; drop *"Specified, not shipped"* and the 17.6 pointer.
  - [x] `DESIGN.md:207` — same treatment inside `DESIGN.md`'s visual-role scope; keep the shadcn-default and reads-the-theme claims; drop the 17.6 pointer.
  - [x] Leave `DESIGN.md:188` (five installed primitives) untouched — it stays true.
  - [x] Move both frontmatter dates to `2026-08-05`: `EXPERIENCE.md` `updated: '2026-08-02'` and `DESIGN.md` `updated: '2026-08-03'`. A file that dates itself must be true about when it last changed.

- [x] **Task 4 — Answer Open Item 4 (AC: 4)**
  - [x] Rewrite `EXPERIENCE.md:330` (`:322` before Task 2's decision block shifted it) as an answered item on the file's own convention for a resolved entry.
  - [x] Record the decision, the deferred wiring, the forward owner, and the four-point technical reason the wiring waits on 17.7.
  - [x] Remove the open question and the uninstall-and-delete branch.

- [x] **Task 5 — Register the forward owner (AC: 6, 7)**
  - [x] `epics.md` — add a `#### Story 17.9:` block after Story 17.8 with a user-story statement, the rule as its contract, the Story 17.7 dependency, and why it was kept out of 17.7 (the Story 17.8 precedent, stated at `epics.md:360`).
  - [x] `epics.md:280` — add 17.9 to Epic 17's status line in the correct group.
  - [x] `epics.md:322-331` — rewrite Story 17.6's block to record the outcome instead of the question.
  - [x] `sprint-status.yaml` — add `17-9-toast-channel-wiring: backlog` after `17-8-guard-criteria-encoding`, with its comment; update this story's row; update `last_updated`. Preserve every existing comment and the STATUS DEFINITIONS block.

- [x] **Task 6 — Verify the closure (AC: 5, 8, 10)**
  - [x] `git grep -niE "owner: story 17\.6|owner Story 17\.6"` → empty. Then inspect every surviving `17.6` / `17-6` hit and confirm each is a past-tense record.
  - [x] `git grep -n "17-9-toast-channel-wiring"` → resolves in both tracking files and from every pointer written above.
  - [x] `git grep -n Toaster src/`, `git grep -n "toast(" src/`, `git grep -n sonner package.json` → unchanged from the table.
  - [x] `git status --porcelain` → no path under `src/`, `tests/`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`.
  - [x] `npm test` → green. Record the counts.
  - [x] Open every `file:line` citation this change set wrote and confirm it resolves.

- [x] **Task 7 — The spine repair (AC: 9)**
  - [x] Do **not** edit `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md`.
  - [x] Report that the `:464` *Deferred* bullet needs the repair specified in AC-9, and state the five things it must achieve, so the `bmad-architecture` Update run has an unambiguous target.
  - [x] Do not mark this story `done` until that run has landed.

- [x] **Task 8 — Commit audit before any commit or push (AC: 8)**
  - [x] Refuse to stage `.env*`, `data/local/`, `data/uploads/`, `data.db*`, `slides*/`, `*.pptx` / `*.potx`, or any real congregation / payment / production-host data.
  - [x] Run `node --import ./tests/register-ts-resolve.mjs --test --experimental-strip-types tests/public-repo-guard.test.mjs` and fix content on failure — never weaken the guard.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture judgement: no new `AD` is required, and this is the stronger claim

**No structural invariant moves.** No storage target, no auth gate, no slide-order source, no schema path. No route or surface is added or removed — Story 17.7 adds the route group and `17-9` mounts into it; both obligations belong to those stories. `EXPERIENCE.md` owns behavioural channel rules by the authority map in `AGENTS.md`, and that is where the rule lands.

**"Channel" here is not the structural sense of the word.** The invariant `AGENTS.md` names is the **sync channel** — AD-10's presenter↔projector `BroadcastChannel` carrying deck state. A toast is neither persisted state nor a cross-surface transport: nothing is stored, nothing is agreed on between windows, and nothing reaches a room-facing surface. AD-24's three storage tiers are not engaged.

**And AD-24 already answers the mount question, which is why applying it is enough.** Its rule at `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:212` makes the mount **decidable**: enumerate the provider's consumers, mount at the narrowest layout containing all of them, and root is the answer only when that enumeration is *every route*. Operator routes only is the ceiling that enumeration is bounded to (`ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:213`) — `toast(` has zero call sites in `src/` today, so nothing has actually been enumerated; the projector and the slideshow are the room-facing set AD-24 forbids outright, which is what keeps the eventual answer inside operator routes. Either way that ceiling is not *every route*, so an operator-scoped route-segment layout is the right mount **as a consequence of a decision already recorded**, not as a new preference — and this story **applies** AD-24 rather than amending it, deferring to whichever story creates that segment.

**That is also why the spine work is a repair rather than an amendment.** The `:464` *Deferred* bullet describes a live question that this story answers; nothing in AD-24 changes. Small enough to be blocking (AC-9) rather than a story of its own.

**If you conclude otherwise — that an `AD` is genuinely needed — stop and ask.** Do not edit the spine, and do not proceed on the assumption that a new `AD` is fine to add inline. `AGENTS.md`: never renumber an existing `AD-n`; add the next one, and route it through a `bmad-architecture` Update run.

### Registration precedent: a new key, not a bigger 17.7

Story 17.8 was registered exactly this way and the epic states why: *"Kept out of Story 17.7 on purpose: 17.7 owns the shell closure and the two findings above that belong to it, and folding pure guard-hardening in would grow that story and mix two unrelated pieces of work"* (`epics.md:360`). The owner declined folding the toast wiring into 17.7 for the same reason. Mirror 17.8's registration shape.

**The key is load-bearing, not bookkeeping.** This story's own epic block and both Open Item preambles say the same thing in three places — *"an open item with no key is how a finding becomes permanent"* (`DESIGN.md:224`); *"an item with no key is how a finding becomes permanent"* (`EXPERIENCE.md:324`). This story exists because the gap once lived only in a `sprint-status.yaml` `last_updated` comment. **A rule recorded with no forward key would repeat that failure inside the story written to fix it.**

### Previous story intelligence

**Story 17.5** (`17-5-projector-liveness.md`, the immediately preceding story — implemented 2026-08-05, at `review`): its `EXPERIENCE.md` Open Item 1 rewrite is the closest available model for AC-4. It keeps the item, strikes the old claim, records what was true before and what is true now, and cites evidence — rather than deleting the entry. Follow that shape. It also set the precedent that **the epic block is the single source for the evidence** and the `EXPERIENCE.md` item points at it rather than repeating it; that keeps AC-1's *stated once* property achievable.

**Story 17.4** (`EXPERIENCE.md:324-328`, Open Item 3): the other answered-item model, and the one that shows a closure must not overstate. It states plainly that *"An operator who confirms still loses the work — they are now told first."* Apply the same honesty here: this story ships **no operator-visible change at all**, and the artifacts must not read as though a channel started working.

**Story 17.1** — two lessons that bite this story directly. First, from `DESIGN.md:230`: *"a closure lands with the change set that earns it and reverts with it, rather than being written when the work feels done"* — Open Item 2 was marked closed while the story sat at `review` and review then reopened it. AC-9's blocking condition is the same discipline. Second: mounting `<Toaster />` to make AC-5 observable was **explicitly declined by the owner** as a UI surface no story had asked for, during Story 17.1's own review remediation on 2026-07-31 — recorded at `epics.md:373` (Story 17.9's block). *(That fact used to live at the pre-rewrite `epics.md:329`, inside this story's own registration paragraph; this change set's Task 5 rewrote that block and deleted the fact without re-homing it anywhere, leaving no tracked record of the declination — the exact failure mode this story exists to fix, committed by this story. Repaired in a FIX round by adding it to Story 17.9's block, where a future implementer reconciling "wasn't this declined?" will actually look.)* That declination is still in force. It has not been softened by the rule this story writes.

**Story 17.8**: test-only by construction, so no `DESIGN.md` or `EXPERIENCE.md` obligation followed — *"but closing it makes the spine's Deferred ceiling entry stale, and that amendment routes through a `bmad-architecture` Update run rather than an inline edit"* (`epics.md:360`). That sync **did** happen (`ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:465` records it, 2026-08-03), which is the precedent behind AC-9 being blocking rather than deferred.

### Git intelligence

`fbf77e3` is the baseline. Recent history shows the two commit shapes this change set should follow: `5d8100d` *"feat: detect projector liveness…"* for code, and `bbed64b` / `8da704e` — `docs:` — for a record repair and a spine ratification travelling as their **own** change sets. **This story is a `docs:` change set.** A diff touching `src/` is a failed story, not a bigger one.

### Project structure notes

- No new file is created anywhere except this story's own Dev Agent Record.
- Both UX artifacts live at `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-designs/ux-bic-pptx-workflow-2026-07-10/`. There is exactly one of each — do not create a variant.
- There is exactly **one** architecture spine (`AGENTS.md`); the `INIT AD-n` and `epic-16 AD-n` citation forms are retired. Any `AD-n` cited from a document dated before 2026-07-30 must be read through the spine's *AD map* first.
- `sprint-status.yaml` comments and the STATUS DEFINITIONS block are load-bearing and must survive editing. The file's own header has gone stale before and was repaired in-band (`:2-9`) — if you edit the file, its header must be true when you finish.

### Testing requirements

No new test. That is a deliberate consequence of the scope, not an omission: this story changes no code path, adds no module, and alters no behaviour. **The project's rule that a new suite must be registered in `package.json` `scripts.test` in the same change set does not apply, because no suite is added.**

What must hold instead is that the existing suite is provably untouched and green (AC-10). Run the full `npm test`, not only the focused guard, and record the counts in the Dev Agent Record. Note the CI order is load-bearing: `npm ci` → `npm run build` → `npm test`, because `tests/auth-http.test.mjs` spawns the built server.

### One judgement already made for you

`tests/theme-chrome.test.mjs:2022-2024` carries a comment naming Story 17.6 as owning the decision. **Leave it.** Every factual claim in it survives this story — `<Toaster />` is mounted nowhere, `toast(` is called nowhere, both at the owner's direction, and 17.6 is the story that owned the decision. Editing a comment inside a test file to no factual gain would put this story's diff into `tests/`, which AC-8 and AC-10 forbid.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

claude-sonnet-5 (`bmad-dev-story`), dispatched worker session, 2026-08-05.

### Debug Log References

- - `npm test` — full suite **496 tests / 495 pass / 0 fail / 1 skipped** (the skip is the pre-existing one in `tests/registry-assets.test.mjs`, unrelated).
- - **FIX round, 2026-08-05.** `npm test` re-run after the fixes below: full suite **496 tests / 495 pass / 0 fail / 1 skipped** — identical to the entry above, as expected, since this round touched only prose in `EXPERIENCE.md`, `epics.md`, `sprint-status.yaml` and this story file.
- `node --import ./tests/register-ts-resolve.mjs --test --experimental-strip-types tests/public-repo-guard.test.mjs` — **5/5**.
- `node --import ./tests/register-ts-resolve.mjs --test --experimental-strip-types tests/public-repo-guard.test.mjs` — **5/5**.
- `npm test` re-run: full suite **496 tests / 495 pass / 0 fail / 1 skipped**, unchanged, since this round again touched only prose in `epics.md` and this story file.

### Review Findings (FIX round, 2026-08-05)

- Two of three reviewers said "fit to commit" and were wrong — a single reviewer's APPROVE did not close this round, and would not have here.
- **Fixed:** both replaced with a named pointer to `EXPERIENCE.md` → *Component Patterns* → *The transient-confirmation channel: ratified, not wired*; a third, undiscovered instance of the same defect in `EXPERIENCE.md`'s own Open Item 4 (a parenthetical restating all three clauses) was found while fixing the other two and closed the same way.
- Task 2 inserted an 8-line decision block above the `sonner` row and Open Item 4 in `EXPERIENCE.md`, shifting both — and everything below them in the file — down by 8 lines; several citations this story wrote were never repaired afterward: the `sonner` row (`:114`→`:122`, four sites: this story's scope table, Task 3, References, and Completion Notes AC-2) and Open Item 4 (`:322`→`:330`, three […]
- Every citation this change set wrote or moved was re-measured against final line positions rather than trusted from either reviewer — **both reviewers who claimed "all citations resolve" were wrong**; one of them placed the `sonner` row at `:119`, which is also incorrect (it is `:122`).
- **Checked and refuted, left alone:** codex's claim that `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:465` is now the toast repair and that this story's Story-17.8-sync citation there is stale — `:465` was read directly and is still the AD-24 closure-gate bullet carrying the 2026-08-03 Story 17.8 synchronization, exactly as cited.
- - **Scope-blocking finding (codex): the change set touches seven tracked docs plus four untracked architecture-review files instead of an expected six.** The extra files — `deferred-work.md`, `architecture/.memlog.md`, and four files under `architecture/reviews/` — are the `bmad-architecture` Update run's own legitimate artifacts: `.memlog.md` is tracked, `reviews/` already carried 26 tracked […]
- - **Citation claim (codex): `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:465` is stale.** Refuted under item 3 above — `:465` was read directly and confirmed current.

### Review Findings — second FIX round (2026-08-05)

- **F-A — R4's overstatement survived in the story file itself.** The first round's brief named artifact sites in `EXPERIENCE.md`, `epics.md` and `sprint-status.yaml` but never named this story's own *Why the wiring cannot land now* section, so the same defect sat uncorrected in the very story that diagnosed it elsewhere.
- Found and fixed at three sites: (1) `:63` (point 3) read *"Story 17.7 is what creates that segment"* and stated the AD-24 consumer enumeration ("operator routes only") as a performed measurement — corrected to state the real precondition (an operator-scoped segment existing, whoever creates it) and that the enumeration is a ceiling AD-24 imposes rather than a measured list, since `toast(` has […]
- Swept the whole file for the pattern (`operator-facing`, `17.7 is what creates`, `the route group is the right mount`, `enumerate.*consumers`); no further live instances found — one further match (`:271`, this file's own round-1 Review Findings entry) is a historical record of what round 1 fixed and is left as written, on the same convention this project already uses for dated review-run […]
- **F-B — a defect this change set itself introduced, not an external finding.** The story's own Dev Notes (`:194`, *Story 17.1* — second lesson) cited `epics.md:329` for the 2026-07-31 owner declination — mounting `<Toaster />` to make Story 17.1's AC-5 observable was refused as a UI surface no story had asked for.
- Target-text rot (F-B's class — the line still exists but now says something else) needed a content search rather than arithmetic: grepped the full `_bmad-output` tree for the exact phrases this change set deleted (*"Specified, not shipped"*, *"Nothing renders it today"*, *"whether transient confirmation is a channel this product wants at all"*, *"first job is a decision, not an implementation"*) […]
- Checked every other tracked story file that mentions "17.6" or "sonner" (`17-1-reachable-dark-mode.md`, `24-1-string-catalogue-switcher-and-lang.md`, `17-3-app-metadata.md`): `17-1`'s and `17-3`'s hits are into `src/`/`tests/` line numbers this change set never touched, or are dated past-tense records of what was true when *that* story closed — not rotted by this change set.
- **One adjacent finding, reported rather than fixed because it is out of this story's mandate:** `24-1-string-catalogue-switcher-and-lang.md:180` says *"AD-24's Deferred records the second root-level client provider as a live question, first tested by Story 17.6's toast channel"* — that framing is now stale, since the spine's `:464` bullet this change set's AC-9 closed no longer calls the question […]

### Review Findings — third pass, record-only (2026-08-05)

- **What it says, and where.** Introduced by *"The bar is already open above you,"* `24-1:180` reads: *"AD-24's Deferred records the second root-level client provider as a live question, first tested by Story 17.6's toast channel; a locale provider at the root would answer it as a side effect of an infrastructure story, and it would wrap the room-facing routes AC-10 exists to keep closed."*
- **AC-9 made it stale.** This change set's AC-9 closed `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:464` — the bullet `24-1:180` cites and calls *live*.
- Rewriting a `done` story's own prose to track a later, unrelated story's spine repair would set a precedent this project has never adopted — that every closure sweeps every prior story file for drift — and it is not this story's call to invent that rule unilaterally.
- It did **not** sweep every tracked file under `stories/**` for sentences AC-9's spine repair (or any other spine repair) may have made stale; `24-1:180` surfaced incidentally, from a keyword search for "17.6" and "sonner" done for a different reason, not from a systematic pass.
- **Whether a full `stories/**` sweep for post-AC-9 (or post-any-spine-repair) staleness is worth an owner is the coordinator's call, not this story's to make.** If it is done, the cost is roughly: one keyword pass per repaired/closed `Deferred` bullet in `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md` (there are more than the one AC-9 closed) against all ~50 story files, then a read-and-judge pass on each hit at about […]

### Completion Notes List

- - **AC-4.** `EXPERIENCE.md` Open Item 4 rewritten on Story 17.5's Open Item 1 model: struck the old claim, kept the item, recorded what was true before (open question, uninstall-and-delete branch on the table) and what is true now (ratified combined design, wiring deferred), with the four re-verified technical reasons the wiring waits on Story 17.7, and named `17-9-toast-channel-wiring` as […]
- - **AC-8.** Verified: `sonner: ^2.0.7` unchanged in `package.json`; `package-lock.json` byte-identical (never opened); `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` unchanged, still exports `Toaster`; `git grep -n Toaster src/` returns hits only in that file; `git grep -n "toast(" src/` returns nothing; `git status --porcelain` shows no path under `src/`, `tests/`, `package.json` or `package-lock.json`.
- The bullet now reads as **answered** rather than live; states the answer as the combined inline + toast design, ratified 2026-08-05, with the wiring deferred; **retracts** the speculative *"no"* branch the owner declined; moves the owner key from `17-6-toast-channel-decision` to `17-9-toast-channel-wiring`; and drops the `(backlog)` tag naming 17.6 as owner.
- - **AC-10.** `npm test` 496/495/0/1, re-confirmed after the FIX round below (see Debug Log).
- **Every `file:line` citation this change set wrote or moved was re-audited in the FIX round, not merely re-opened on trust** — five stale `EXPERIENCE.md` citations left behind by Task 2's own decision-block insertion were found and repaired (see *Review Findings*), so this clause is now true rather than merely asserted: `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:212` (AD-24 mount rule), `:468` (leaf-file refusal), […]
- It must state the answer: a **combined inline + toast** design, ratified by the owner 2026-08-05, with the wiring deferred.
- The `(backlog)` status tag on that owner key must go (17-9 is `backlog` in `sprint-status.yaml`, but the bullet's own stale-tracking tag describing 17.6 as the backlog owner must be removed, since 17.6 itself is no longer the owner of anything unfinished).

### File List

- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-designs/ux-bic-pptx-workflow-2026-07-10/EXPERIENCE.md` — UPDATE: new dated decision block under *Component Patterns*; `sonner` row (`:122` region, `:114` before the decision block shifted it) rewritten; Open Item 4 (`:330` region) rewritten; frontmatter `updated:` → `2026-08-05`.
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-designs/ux-bic-pptx-workflow-2026-07-10/DESIGN.md` — UPDATE: `sonner` row (`:207` region) rewritten; frontmatter `updated:` → `2026-08-05`. `:188` untouched.
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` — UPDATE: Epic 17 status line (`:280`); Story 17.6's own block rewritten to record the outcome; new `#### Story 17.9:` block added after Story 17.8; first FIX round corrected the mount rationale at `:331`, `:367`, `:369`; second FIX round added a new paragraph to Story 17.9's block (`:373`) re-homing the AC-5 Toaster-decline fact this change set's own rewrite had deleted (see *Review Findings*, F-B).
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` — UPDATE: header narrative and `last_updated` comment (both copies) brought current; Epic 17 comment block's per-story status line repaired; `17-6-toast-channel-decision` → `review` with a dated implementation comment; new `17-9-toast-channel-wiring: backlog` row added after `17-8-guard-criteria-encoding`.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/stories/17-6-toast-channel-decision.md` — UPDATE: this file (Status, Tasks/Subtasks checkboxes, Dev Agent Record, Change Log).

No file under `src/`, `tests/`, `package.json` or `package-lock.json` is in this list, and none was touched. `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md` is not in this list and was not opened for editing.

**The working tree also carries the `bmad-architecture` Update run's own files, and that is by design, not a File List omission:** `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md` itself, `deferred-work.md`, `architecture/.memlog.md`, and four dated files under `architecture/reviews/`. None is in this list because none is this story's to write — see *Scope* above for why they belong in the same change set.

## Change Log

- 2026-08-05: Implemented (`bmad-dev-story`). Documentation-and-registration only, per scope. Recorded the owner's 2026-08-05 ratification of a combined inline + toast channel rule as a dated decision block in `EXPERIENCE.md`; rewrote both `sonner` rows and `EXPERIENCE.md` Open Item 4 from decided-nothing to decided-not-wired; registered forward owner `17-9-toast-channel-wiring` in `epics.md` and `sprint-status.yaml`, dependent on Story 17.7, mirroring Story 17.8's out-of-17.7 registration precedent; rewrote Story 17.6's own `epics.md` block and Epic 17's status line to reflect the outcome (V1 item). Folded in two validation-pass items: 17.6's own status tags repaired in the same change set (V1), and two dated 2026-07-31 architecture-review files inspected and deliberately left as historical records with a stated reason (V2). No file under `src/`, `tests/`, `package.json` or `package-lock.json` touched; `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md` not opened. Full suite 496/495/0/1 (unchanged from Story 17.5's same-day baseline); theme-chrome 58/58; public-repo guard 5/5. Status → `review`. **AC-9 blocks `done`:** the five repair targets for `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:464` are stated in the Dev Agent Record for the `bmad-architecture` Update run; this story does not make the `done` call.
- 2026-08-05 FIX ROUND (`bmad-dev-story`): three independent reviewers ran in parallel (codex, Gemini Flash, Gemini Pro); split verdict recorded in *Review Findings* — codex found four real defects, Gemini Flash found one of the four, Gemini Pro found none. Fixed: AC-1's two `epics.md` restatements of the three-clause rule (`:329`, `:367`, plus one found in `EXPERIENCE.md` Open Item 4 while fixing the others) replaced with a named pointer, and AC-1 reworded so the *stated once* property is precise about this story's own `:87-93` specification rather than either violated by it or served by deleting it; AC-9 recorded as **CLOSED ON EVIDENCE** — the `bmad-architecture` Update run's repair of `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:464` had already landed in this working tree, but this story and `sprint-status.yaml` still called it pending; citation rot from Task 2's own decision-block insertion repaired throughout (`EXPERIENCE.md:114`→`:122`, `:322`→`:330`, `:306`→`:314`, `:316-320`→`:324-328`, plus this story's own stale `epics.md:331` quote at `:23`); the mount rationale in `EXPERIENCE.md`, `epics.md` and `sprint-status.yaml` corrected to state Story 17.7's actual registered contract (one route-group layout owning every room-facing URL) rather than an operator-facing one it has not promised, naming the real precondition — an operator-scoped route segment existing, whoever creates it. Refuted and recorded rather than silently dropped: codex's scope-blocking finding that the change set touches an unexpected seventh-plus file — the extras are the `bmad-architecture` Update run's own legitimate artifacts, and this story's scope table is widened to say so; codex's claim that `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:465` is now stale — checked directly and confirmed current, unchanged. No file under `src/`, `tests/`, `package.json` or `package-lock.json` touched; `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md` not opened by this story. Full suite re-run: 496/495/0/1, identical to the entry above; public-repo guard 5/5. Status stays `review`.
- 2026-08-05 SECOND FIX ROUND (`bmad-dev-story`): the coordinator verified the first round's four closures directly against the files and confirmed all four correct; two narrower items remained. **F-A:** R4's mount-rationale overstatement survived in this story's own *Why the wiring cannot land now* section and Dev Notes — the first round's brief named artifact sites but not the story's own body. Fixed at `:63`, `:65` and `:176`: *"Story 17.7 is what creates that segment"* and the AD-24 consumer enumeration stated as a performed measurement are both corrected to name the real precondition (an operator-scoped segment existing, whoever creates it) and the ceiling AD-24 imposes rather than a measured list. Swept the whole file for the pattern; no further live instances found. **F-B, recorded honestly as a defect this change set introduced, not an external finding:** the first round's own citation re-audit flagged `:194`'s reference to `epics.md:329` as unresolved but stopped short of explaining why. This round traced it: the 2026-07-31 owner declination it cites (mounting `<Toaster />` to make Story 17.1's AC-5 observable was refused as an unasked-for surface) used to live inside this story's own pre-rewrite `epics.md:322-331` paragraph, and this change set's own Task 5 deleted it when rewriting that paragraph to record the ratified outcome, without re-homing it anywhere — the fact survived nowhere in the tracked planning artifacts except as an unsourced paraphrase in this story's Dev Notes. Fixed by adding it to `epics.md`'s Story 17.9 block (`:373`) — the story that now asks for the surface the 2026-07-31 declination said no story had asked for — and repairing `:194`'s citation to point there. Re-audited the story and the four artifacts for the same class of defect (target text rewritten, not merely shifted): grepped for every deleted phrase this change set removed; nothing else rotted. One adjacent, out-of-mandate finding reported rather than fixed: `stories/24-1-string-catalogue-switcher-and-lang.md:180` calls the AD-24 second-root-provider question "live," which AC-9's spine repair made stale — a different story, outside this dev-story's scope to edit. No file under `src/`, `tests/`, `package.json` or `package-lock.json` touched; `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md` not opened. Full suite re-run: 496/495/0/1, unchanged; public-repo guard 5/5. Status stays `review`.
- 2026-08-05 THIRD PASS, RECORD-ONLY (`bmad-dev-story`): the coordinator ruled on the `24-1-string-catalogue-switcher-and-lang.md:180` item flagged (and correctly left untouched) in the second FIX round — **leave the sentence, record the disposition**, on consistency with the first round's own treatment of the two dated 2026-07-31 architecture-review files (*V2* above). Recorded in *Review Findings*: what `24-1:180` says and where; that AC-9 made it stale; that it stays as a `done` story's dated record rather than being edited to track a later, unrelated story's spine repair (`24-1-string-catalogue-switcher-and-lang: done`, `sprint-status.yaml:659`); and the one condition that would change the answer — a future reader of `24-1:180` treating it as live guidance needs to re-read `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:464` first. Stated the limit of this and the prior round's search plainly: neither swept `stories/**` systematically for post-spine-repair staleness; `24-1:180` surfaced incidentally, and whether a full sweep is worth an owner is named as a coordinator call, with a rough cost estimate, not performed here. No file edited except this story and `sprint-status.yaml`'s mirrored row comment; `24-1-string-catalogue-switcher-and-lang.md` and `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md` both left untouched, per the coordinator's explicit boundary. No code or test changes, so the full suite was not re-run for this pass — see the prior FIX round's entry for the last measured counts (496/495/0/1; public-repo guard 5/5), still current since nothing under `src/`, `tests/`, `package.json` or `package-lock.json` has changed. Status stays `review`.
- 2026-08-06 **CLOSED BY THE OWNER — `Status: done`.** All ten ACs carry a recorded disposition and none is open. `AC-9`, the story's only blocking obligation, was `CLOSED ON EVIDENCE` by the `bmad-architecture` Update run that repaired `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:464` in the same change set — the channel `AGENTS.md` reserves that edit for, and the gate the owner twice held Story 17.1 open over. Shipped as `ba222af` / PR #35, with `test` and `Greptile Review` both green; the coordinator re-ran the suite (496 tests / 495 pass / 0 fail / 1 pre-existing skip) and the public-repo guard (5/5) rather than quoting a worker's numbers. `epics.md` heading tag, Epic 17's status line, and the `sprint-status.yaml` header, Epic 17 block and row were all moved in this same edit, because a file that dates itself must be true about the state it describes — this file's header had gone stale before, and 17.6's own subject is artifacts that describe what is not so. **THE CLOSE CARRIES ONE STATED GAP: the final state of this change set was never read by an independent reviewer.** The trio reviewed the pre-fix tree; two fix rounds then closed four findings and found three sites no reviewer had flagged, and only the coordinator verified the result. The coordinator recommended one further independent pass, citing this project's own record that round-3 fixes produced round-4 headline findings; the owner elected to close instead. That trade was made knowingly and is recorded here, in `sprint-status.yaml`'s header, and in its row — so a later finding in this change set reads as a known risk accepted rather than as a gap nobody saw.
