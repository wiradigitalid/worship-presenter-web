> **Canonical contract.** This SPEC and the files in `companions:` are the complete, preservation-validated contract for what to build, test, and validate. Source documents listed in frontmatter are for traceability only.
>
> **Correct Course.** This contract supersedes Story 16.1 non-goals that forbade create/delete/reorder and treated the registry as an unordered template catalog only. Where adopted Epic 16 companions conflict with this SPEC (including the seven-base-type authoring model), **this SPEC wins**.
>
> **Delivery status — added 2026-07-30.** Adopted whole by owner decision and now tracked as **Epic 20** in `../../planning-artifacts/epics.md`, one story per capability (`20-1`…`20-8` in `sprint-status.yaml`), all `backlog`. Until that date this SPEC had a supersession claim over shipped code and **no epic, story or sprint key at all** — the claim above was therefore unenforceable and unscheduled, which is how it sat for weeks while `artifact_templates` still had no ordering column and the admin API no create/delete/reorder verb. **One adoption consequence is recorded in the epic, not here:** the `base_type` migration implied by *Constraints* (seven types to three kinds). The other — CAP-6 **reversing** architecture decision `AD-14`'s "global across services" clause — is no longer open: the spine now carries **AD-16 (Service-Bound Registry Snapshot)**, added the same day, which records that reversal directly. Story 20.8 is unblocked **at spine altitude**; two items still stand there. Where the snapshot lives physically is its own design call (`ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md`), and `EXPERIENCE.md` → *Venue & Projection Constraints* still states the global-and-immediate rule with Flow 5's climax turning on it — `epics.md:374` records that as what remains of Story 20.8's block.

# Ordered Artifact Registry Authoring

## Why

**Pain + vision.** Operators already have a live Presenter deck and an Artifact Registry, but the registry is an alphabetical template catalog with no boundary to manage **order**, **names**, or rich layout the way the Presenter list implies. Separating “template catalog” from “instance order” without an authoring surface for the ordered deck makes the registry feel useless for day-to-day control. The product direction is an **ordered Artifact Registry** as the central place to author deck structure and General-slide visuals, with **SongSet** and **Announcement** as special system expanders, while weekly values still flow from worship intake. Creating a service clones that registry; **Sync Artifact** can refresh the clone.

## Capabilities

- **CAP-1**
  - **intent:** The system maintains one ordered Artifact Registry that defines which slides exist and in what sequence for live presentation generation.
  - **success:** Reordering two registry entries and creating a new service yields Presenter/PPTX in that sequence without editing TypeScript plan constants.

- **CAP-2**
  - **intent:** An administrator can add, delete, rename, and reorder registry entries, including inserting special **SongSet** and **Announcement** entries.
  - **success:** After Save, the ordered list persists; a new service clone and Presenter list reflect the same order, kinds, and labels. Adding a SongSet entry means claiming one of the four slot identities **not currently in the order** — a second row claiming an identity already present, or a fifth slot invented in the UI, is refused (`AD-19`). Announcement carries **no** such cap: it may be added more than once. Neither kind can be deleted from the predefined set at all; `delete` removes a row from the order and nothing more.

- **CAP-3**
  - **intent:** For **General** slides only, an administrator can fully author the canvas: background; insert images, text, and text areas; drag, resize; font color, size, and style (bold, italic, underline); Save required.
  - **success:** A round-trip General-slide edit survives reload and appears equivalently in web Presenter and PPTX for a service using that snapshot.

- **CAP-4**
  - **intent:** A central predefined Placeholder Catalog can be inserted onto **General** slides and styled locally; weekly worship fields fill those bindings.
  - **success:** Sermon graphic works as General + image placeholder; Family/Youth as General + family/youth photo and prayer placeholders; the same catalog key can appear on multiple Generals with different styling; UI cannot invent new catalog keys.

- **CAP-5**
  - **intent:** Each registry entry has a kind of **General**, **SongSet**, or **Announcement**, plus an editable label; lists show `[kind] label`.
  - **success:** Renaming a General sequence slide’s label updates Presenter badges for services that clone/sync afterward; Announcement and SongSet rows never open a freeform canvas. The **label is the only** part of a row an administrator edits: no surface exposes the row’s kind or its SongSet slot identity **for editing** (`AD-19` bars editing, not display). What is *shown* is `EXPERIENCE.md`’s call — the chip shows the kind, and the `AD-22` bounded surface states the row’s slot read-only in worship vocabulary. The raw `songset-*` key reaches no human surface at all.

- **CAP-6**
  - **intent:** Creating a worship service clones the full ordered Artifact Registry into a service-bound snapshot; **Sync Artifact** replaces that snapshot from the live registry.
  - **success:** Live registry edits do not affect an existing service until Sync; after Sync, structure/layout/order/labels match the live registry.

- **CAP-7**
  - **intent:** **Announcement** is a registry entry that expands to full-screen images from the Announcements list; upload means fullscreen with no extra elements.
  - **success:** Presenter/PPTX show one full-bleed slide per announcement image; there is no canvas editor for an Announcement entry. One row is the usual configuration but not a rule — the order admits more than one, and each expands the **whole** live list, because membership is the Announcements master list and no row selects a subset of it. **Repetition is the intended use, not a degenerate case:** the same announcement block may sit at the start, middle, and end of one service, showing the same images each time. No surface deduplicates repeated rows, collapses them, or warns about them.

- **CAP-8**
  - **intent:** **SongSet** entries are expandable title+lyric blocks with configurable backgrounds; four predefined slots (Bible Talk opening/closing, Divine Service opening/closing) ship in the registry and receive per-slot hymnal numbers from worship-service settings.
  - **success:** Reordering the four SongSet rows changes Presenter sequence; setting distinct hymn numbers on a service fills each slot’s title/lyrics; changing a SongSet background in the registry appears on that slot’s expanded pages after create/sync without opening a freeform canvas of arbitrary elements.

## Constraints

- Weekly placeholder **values** and announcement image membership continue to come from worship-service intake and the Announcements menu — not from inventing content inside the registry canvas.
- `buildSlidePlan` (or successor) consumes the **ordered registry snapshot** (per service) as the sequence source.
- Slide kinds are exactly three: General, SongSet, Announcement (`slide-kinds.md`). Epic 16’s TextPlaceholder / ImagePlaceholder / MixPlaceholder / FullScreenImage are retired as distinct kinds.
- Every **cross-boundary key** is a server-owned value no authoring surface may edit: a row’s kind, its SongSet slot identity, and every Placeholder Catalog key. `AD-19` fixes the recognized entry set as **closed at six keys over three kinds** — `general`, the four `songset-*` slot identities, `announcement` — with at most one row per slot identity, and bare `song-set` naming the kind but never an entry. Extending the vocabulary is code + tests.
- **The predefined set and the order are two levels, and only the order is administrator-mutable.** The special kinds the system offers — the four `songset-*` identities and `announcement` — are permanently available; no administrator action removes anything from that set, and `delete` on a row means **removal from the order** only. Membership rules differ per kind and are not interchangeable: each `songset-*` identity may sit in the order **at most once** and may be absent (an absent slot is a valid configuration, not an error); `announcement` may appear **more than once** and carries no cap. A removed row is re-addable by the administrator, never a developer ticket.
- Placeholder Catalog extensions require code + tests.
- Public-repository rules unchanged.
- Explicit Save for registry/canvas mutations; no autosave.
- SongSet entries expose a **bounded configuration surface** (label, order, background) but not freeform multi-element canvas authoring of every lyric page. `AD-22` fixes the exact extent of that surface — two background images, one for the title layout and one for the lyric layout, plus font style and font size — and no surface may widen it.
- The four predefined SongSet slots have **stable identities** so worship-service settings can bind hymnal numbers per slot even if display labels or order change.

## Non-goals

- Canvas editing for Announcement or per-lyric SongSet pages.
- Editing layout on the Presenter playback UI during the service.
- Operator-defined arbitrary placeholder keys without code.
- Video elements or full Canva-suite parity beyond General CAP-3.
- Work in the frozen `bic-pptx-workflow` repository.

## Success signal

Admin builds an ordered registry with Generals, the four predefined SongSets (with backgrounds), and Announcement; Saves; creates a service (clone); sets hymnal numbers for BT open/close and DS open/close on the service. Presenter expands each SongSet to title+lyrics with the configured backgrounds; Sync Artifact refreshes structure from the live registry.

## Assumptions

- Migrated seed ordered registry mirrors today’s plan sequence, mapping today’s four song positions to the four predefined SongSet slots plus Generals/Announcement as appropriate.
- Multiple SongSet rows beyond the four defaults may be added later only if new stable slot identities and form bindings are introduced in code; v1 ships the four named slots.
- Worship services that already exist when this model ships (no clone yet) continue to render from their stored `parsed_data` plus the then-current live registry until an operator freezes/clones or syncs one for them.

*Retired 2026-08-07:* a fourth assumption stood here — that CAP-2’s “add a SongSet entry” means claiming an identity not currently in the order. The owner **ratified** it, so it is contract now (CAP-2 success, and the predefined-set-versus-order Constraint) rather than an assumption. Three remain, and none is flagged for ratification.

## Open Questions

<!-- none — the one opened 2026-08-07 (what a second Announcement row is for) was answered by the owner the same day: repeating the same set at start / middle / end, never splitting it. Recorded in CAP-7. -->
