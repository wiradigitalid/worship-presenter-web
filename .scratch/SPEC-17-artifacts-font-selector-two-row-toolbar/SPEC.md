# SPEC-17 — Artifacts Canvas Font Selector (45 Curated Fonts) & Two-Row Fixed Toolbar

## Problem Statement

The Artifacts canvas editor (`ArtifactEditor.tsx`) currently locks text elements to the default fallback font (`Arial`) with no font family picker interface. Furthermore, as features have expanded (color picker, size input, B/I/U toggles, alignments, line-height slider, text-shadow controls), the single-row properties toolbar (`h-11 min-h-[44px]`) has become congested. If a font picker is crammed into the same single line, controls overflow horizontally or wrap awkwardly on laptop viewports.

Moreover, operators and worship designers require a rich, curated palette of typography suitable for presentations, lyric projection, sermon titles, and PowerPoint export—spanning clean modern sans-serifs, dignified serifs, high-impact display headers, and elegant script/handwriting fonts, alongside universal system fonts that render natively across all PowerPoint installations.

Lastly, dynamically changing toolbar heights when switching between Text, Shape, Image, and None causes vertical layout shifts that push the canvas and deck sequence up and down. A locked, predictable two-row toolbar (`h-[88px] min-h-[88px] max-h-[88px]`) guarantees zero canvas jump regardless of selection state.

## Solution Architecture

1. **45-Font Curated Catalog (`src/lib/registry/font-catalog.ts`)**:
   - Establish a typed, grouped catalog of 45 high-utility presentation fonts:
     - **System Safe / PPTX Universal (10)**: Arial, Calibri, Aptos, Segoe UI, Verdana, Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Georgia, Times New Roman, Garamond.
     - **Modern Sans-Serif (12)**: Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat, Poppins, Nunito, Raleway, Oswald, Barlow Condensed, DM Sans, Work Sans.
     - **Dignified Serif (8)**: Merriweather, Playfair Display, Lora, Cinzel, Cormorant Garamond, PT Serif, EB Garamond, Baskervville.
     - **Bold Display & Title Impact (8)**: Bebas Neue, Anton, League Spartan, Righteous, Teko, Abril Fatface, Alfa Slab One, Russo One.
     - **Script & Handwriting (7)**: Great Vibes, Pacifico, Caveat, Dancing Script, Sacramento, Shadows Into Light, Satisfy.
   - Load web font stylesheets via Google Fonts with `display=swap` asynchronously in `spa/index.html` and `spa/projected.html`.
   - Export helper `getFontStack(fontFamily)` providing web-safe fallback chains.

2. **Fixed Height Two-Row Properties Toolbar (`h-[88px]` in `ArtifactEditor.tsx`)**:
   - Transform the element properties toolbar container into a fixed two-row panel:
     `rounded-lg bg-background border border-border text-xs h-[88px] min-h-[88px] max-h-[88px] p-2 flex flex-col justify-between shrink-0`.
   - **Row 1 (Primary Typography & Element Identity)**:
     - Element Kind Badge (`[TEXT]`, `[SHAPE]`, `[IMAGE]`, `[NONE]`).
     - Font Family Selector: grouped `<Select>` (`w-[180px] h-8 text-xs`) rendering all 5 categories with preview font-family styling.
     - Font Size input (`w-16 h-8 text-center`) + Font Color picker (`w-6 h-6`).
     - Bold, Italic, Underline buttons (`size="icon-sm"`).
     - Alignment buttons: Left, Center, Right (`size="icon-sm"`).
   - **Row 2 (Advanced Effects & Sliders)**:
     - Line Height button & slider (`0.8` to `2.4`).
     - Text Shadow toggle button & blur slider (`0` to `20`).
   - **State Containment (Non-Text Elements)**:
     - **Shape selected**: Row 1 renders Shape Fill color picker; Row 2 renders Shape properties indicator.
     - **Image selected**: Row 1 renders Image label and dimensions; Row 2 renders Object Fit (contain/cover) controls.
     - **None selected**: Row 1 renders *"Properties (None): Select element first"*; Row 2 renders keyboard shortcut hints (*"Tip: Del/Backspace to delete, Drag to move"*).
     - **Zero layout shift**: The toolbar height remains strictly 88px across all states, keeping the canvas position 100% stationary.

3. **Multi-Surface Synchronization & PPTX Export**:
   - `pptx-draw.ts`: `resolveFontFamily(style)` maps selected font family into PowerPoint slides seamlessly via pptxgenjs `fontFace`.
   - `ArtifactSlide.tsx` & `ProjectorClient.tsx`: inherit and apply `fontFamily` dynamically with CSS fallback stacks.
   - Server validator `validate_artifact.go` already permits `fontFamily` in `allowedStyleKeys`.

## User Stories

1. As a Worship Leader/Admin, I want to choose from 45 popular presentation fonts across modern, serif, display, and script styles, so that our church slides match our visual theme.
2. As an Admin editing slides, I want the element properties toolbar to occupy a comfortable, fixed two-row layout that never jumps or shifts the canvas vertically when switching element selection.
3. As an Operator, I want exported PowerPoint decks to reflect the exact font family chosen in the canvas editor.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Font family dropdown in `ArtifactEditor.tsx` contains 45 fonts grouped into 5 clear categories.
2. Changing font family immediately updates the active text element on the Fabric.js canvas in real-time.
3. The properties toolbar container maintains an exact fixed height `h-[88px] min-h-[88px] max-h-[88px]` across Text, Shape, Image, and None states with zero vertical canvas shift.
4. Exported PPTX presentations carry the selected font face.
5. All automated unit, layout, and regression tests pass without errors.
