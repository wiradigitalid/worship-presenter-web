# SRS — Presenter

## Decision Summary · [G3]

Presenter is the Sabbath turn in the browser: slideshow, two screens, on-demand verse. The offline guarantee remains PPTX (Hub UC-18).

## Why · [G3]

The Operator needs a control screen separate from what the Congregation sees. That is not Hub (prep) and not Registry (structure).

## Actor Register · [G3]

| Actor | Who they are | What they may do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operator | On-duty at the venue laptop | Slideshow, presenter, projector, verse |
| Congregation | Screen audience | Do not open this surface |

## UC Catalogue · [G3]

| id | Use case | Actor | Satisfies | critical |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UC-11 | I present a fullscreen slideshow | Operator | FR-15 | no |
| UC-12 | I run the two-screen presenter | Operator | FR-16 | no |
| UC-13 | I display an on-demand verse on the projector | Operator | FR-19, FR-22 | no |
| UC-27 | I switch the live Verse/Reff background during the service | Operator | FR-33 | no |
| UC-29 | I control the presenting laptop from my phone while standing away from it | Operator | FR-35 | no |

## Constraints · [G3]

Operator Chrome does not reach the room screen. Source: AD-24 (adopted) in the spine.

A remote control device (UC-29, DEC-006) is an **input to this component, never a second controller**: it sends intents to the presenting client, and the presenting client stays the only sender the projector follows. The laptop-to-projector path MUST keep working with the remote closed, asleep, or off the network — the room screen never depends on connectivity (AD-37, and AD-1's offline guarantee behind it). Reaching a presenting client is a deliberate act, not a consequence of being signed in.

A live background switch (UC-27, DEC-004) changes what the projector shows for the current Verse/Reff slide only; it never rewrites the Service payload or the Registry, and it does not survive past this session the way a Sync Artifact does — the next generate still resolves the background through the normal order (weekly choice → global default → blank).

## Non-Goals · [G3]

- Edit weekly payload — Hub.
- Change slide order live — brief Scope Out.
- Offline guarantee — Hub FR-14.

## Prerequisite · [G3]

A Service already exists. Verse overlay (FR-19) requires the two-screen presenter (FR-16).

## Success Signal · [G3]

Projector shows only slides. Blank does not itself shift Deck position. Slideshow order matches the Deck/PPTX. A verse overlay leaves the Service payload unchanged.

## Assumptions, Risks, and To Be Confirmed · [G3]

### Assumptions

PPTX remains the offline guarantee; the browser slideshow is best-effort after one Service is loaded (OQ-5).

Blank covers an open overlay; unblank reveals that overlay if it is still open. Reload of control or projector resends index, overlay, and blank (OQ-25).

Plan identity on the presenter channel stays deferred (AD-10). Empty verse reference and lookup timeout fail closed (SCN-4). No projector → refuse lookup. Missing Service or plan → return to Hub as UC-11; presenter does not open (OQ-26).

### Risks

Slideshow is mistaken for the Sabbath guarantee.
