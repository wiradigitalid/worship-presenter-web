# SRS — Hub

## Decision Summary · [G3]

Hub is the Operator's door: sign in, create a Service from this week's Rundown, list, Run-Sheet, edit, generate, download PPTX, accounts, language settings. **Not announcements** — composing them moved to the Artifact Registry when FR-3 was retired (DEC-004), which is why UC-21 below is struck through. This sentence listed them until 2026-08-22. Telegram via picoclaw (UC-1, UC-17) is last-phase intake, not this phase's handover.

## Why · [G3]

Without Hub, the multimedia turn falls back to one person assembling files. This component is the surface Operators call "the app".

## Actor Register · [G3]

| Actor | Who they are | What they may do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operator | Multimedia team | List, create, edit, generate, download, delete, Run-Sheet. **Not announcements** (FR-3 retired, DEC-004) |
| Events | Later: Rundown sender on Telegram | Not a Hub user this phase |
| Admin | Account and settings manager | Accounts, transitions, locale |

## UC Catalogue · [G3]

UC Catalogue — see `.control/registry/usecases.yaml`, rows where `component: hub`.

UC-1 and UC-17 realise CAP-11 (Telegram, last phase). This phase's create path is UC-2.

UC-21's promise is withdrawn with FR-3: Hub no longer composes or reorders any announcement/flyer list — that is Registry UC-14 (edit a slide within an Announcement Set) and UC-15 (reorder/delete within it), per DEC-004. The one property of UC-21 that survives is asset reuse — a copied image shares one file by reference rather than a fresh upload each week — and it now lives on the Registry side, carried structurally by FR-21 (`offline-deck` PRD) rather than by anything Hub does.

## Constraints · [G3]

- Hub is not public — brief Constraints. Source: brief.
- Congregation data does not enter git — brief. Source: `.constitution/project/public-repository.md`.
- Create and edit share one field set and card order. Weekly values (hymn numbers, song books, backgrounds, names, verses, lyric corrections) are entered in Hub, not on the Artifact Registry. **Flyers are not among them any more** — they were until FR-3 was retired (DEC-004); an Announcement Set is authored structure in the Registry, and Hub only previews how it expands. Source: as-built forms; FR-27 · FR-11 · FR-32 · FR-34.

## Non-Goals · [G3]

- Assemble slide order — Registry.
- Projector / two-screen presenter — Presenter.
- Be a congregation website.

## Prerequisite · [G3]

Song Book is shipped. `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is for the later Telegram path (CAP-11, OQ-4).

## Success Signal · [G3]

Friday review ≤ 10 minutes; the Operator creates this week's Service in Hub without assembling PowerPoint.

## Assumptions, Risks, and To Be Confirmed · [G3]

### Assumptions

- OQ-17 — The Operator has this week's Rundown content in time to enter it in Hub. Wrong: no Service that week.
- OQ-2 — One church, one worship flow, for this product's scope. Wrong: Scope In is not enough.
- OQ-1 is parked on CAP-11 (Events parseable Rundown when Telegram ships).

### Risks

Payload holds photos and prayers until manual delete.

### To Be Confirmed

OQ-4 — When will the production host set `AUTH_SECRET`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and a durable path for the database? External; not G3.

## Gate Checklist · [G3]

★ UC titles are user sentences: yes. ★ FR without a UC: FR-26 `no_uc`.

## Open Items

OQ-17 · OQ-2 · OQ-4. OQ-6 answered (DEC-003). OQ-1 is parked on CAP-11. Taken and encoded here: OQ-20 (generate is not a payload edit; BR-4 is UC-5) · OQ-21 (no readable date → no row; named date with no Service rejects, no nearest-Sabbath fallback) · OQ-22 (unparseable Hub body with a date still saves what was readable; Telegram images attach or fail visibly) · OQ-23 (gone on re-read is UC-7 not-found; session expiry at save/delete rejects with no partial write).
