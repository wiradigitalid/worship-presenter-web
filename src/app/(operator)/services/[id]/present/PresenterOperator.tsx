/**
 * Operator console, arranged the way PowerPoint's presenter view is: the
 * current slide top-left, the next slide top-right, a thumbnail filmstrip and
 * the slide list bottom-left, and the operator's own panels (scripture,
 * run-sheet) bottom-right, with an "All slides" grid for jumping anywhere in
 * the deck.
 *
 * Two sizing rules make it comfortable from FullHD to 4K:
 *  - the current slide is capped in *both* axes by `--presenter-stage`, so a
 *    large monitor gives its extra pixels to the strip, the list and the
 *    run-sheet instead of inflating one slide;
 *  - below `lg` the two columns stack and the page scrolls, so a narrow window
 *    never overflows horizontally.
 *
 * The shell declares `dark` rather than hardcoding zinc colours. Every control
 * inside it is a theme-token component, so marking the surface dark is what
 * makes `--background` / `--foreground` resolve dark for them; painting zinc on
 * top while the tokens stayed light is what made the "Open projector" button
 * white-on-white.

 * The cap on the current slide. Width is the smaller of a fixed maximum and the
 * width a 16:9 stage may have before it would push the rest of the column off
 * the viewport, with a floor so a very short window still shows something.
 * Capping the width of an `aspect-video` box caps the height with it, so the box
 * stays exactly 16:9 and the slide never letterboxes inside its own frame.
 *
 * `30rem` is everything else in that column, measured rather than guessed:
 * header 3.75, page padding 2, three 0.75 gaps 2.25, the "Current" label 1.25,
 * transport row 2, filmstrip 7.95 (thumbnail 4.5 + its frame 0.75 + caption
 * 1.15 + strip padding 0.75 + the horizontal scrollbar ~0.8), and 10.8 for the
 * slide list.
 *
 * It was 21rem before the filmstrip. Note what that arithmetic means: while the
 * `min()` binds, the stage takes exactly the height this term does *not*, so
 * every rem added here lands on the slide list one-for-one at any viewport. The
 * strip is therefore paid for by the current slide (about 6% of its width at
 * FullHD, nothing at all at 2K and above where the 64rem cap binds instead) and
 * the vertical list keeps the room it had.
 *
 * The floor went 20rem -> 24rem for the same reason, in the other direction. On
 * a short window (a 1366x768 laptop leaves ~660px) the fixed costs dominate and
 * the floor is what binds, so the reserve stops being a guarantee and the
 * leftover falls to the list instead; measured there, 20rem spent the
 * filmstrip's height out of the current slide and left the list with more than
 * it needs. 24rem keeps the slide readable and still fits — the column needs
 * ~525px at that floor, against the ~516px the 20rem floor needed before, so it
 * adds no clipping risk that the shipped layout did not already carry.
