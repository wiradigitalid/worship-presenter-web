 * The Presenter → projector wire.

 * state carries the *intended* value rather than an instruction to flip one:
 * a bare "toggle blank" is fragile because two windows that missed different
 * messages disagree about whose turn it is, and they stay disagreeing. With the
 * state on the wire, a late or duplicated message is idempotent. The same rule
 * is why `transition` names the style it wants rather than saying "next style":
 * two projectors given a cycle instruction would end up on different styles the
 * moment one of them missed a message, and they would never converge again.
 *
 * `sync` therefore answers `request-sync` with the deck position, the blank
 * state *and* the live transition, so a projector opened or reloaded mid-session
 * comes up correct on the one round trip it already makes.
