/**
 * The browser half of a slide transition, shared by the projector and the
 * slideshow so the two surfaces cannot drift from each other or from the deck.
 * Every visual parameter comes from the table in `./transitions`; this hook
 * only owns the timing.
 *
 * The mechanism it replaces was not a cross-fade at all: one slide was mounted
 * and the index swapped on the frame *after* the opacity started dropping, so
 * a "fade" read as a cut into a fade-in. Here the outgoing slide stays mounted
 * underneath the incoming one for the run's duration, which is what makes a
 * cross-fade cross and gives a push something to push.
