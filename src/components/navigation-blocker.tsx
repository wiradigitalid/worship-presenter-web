/**
 * A page-scoped way for one surface to refuse to be navigated away from, and
 * for the shared header's links to honour that refusal.
 *
 * Shape: a context, a `CustomLink` that calls `event.preventDefault()` from
 * `onNavigate`, and a provider. Inventing a `popstate` interception instead
 * would be a second mechanism to keep working.
 *
 * **Two deliberate departures, both load-bearing.**
 *
 * `AD-24` says a client boundary mounts at the narrowest layout covering its
 * consumers. The only writer (`ArtifactEditor`) and the only readers
 * (`Header`'s links, as rendered on that same page) both live inside
 * `AdminArtifactsPage` — so it mounts there. Every other gated page renders
 * `Header` with no provider above it, reads the module default
 * (`isBlocked: false`) and behaves exactly as before. That is why the default is
 * a real value and not `undefined` guarded by a throwing hook: a hook that
 * insisted on a provider would break every page that legitimately has none.
 *
 * Writing `onNavigate` *before* `{...props}` lets a caller pass their own and
 * silently switch the guard off. The spread goes first here, and `onNavigate`
 * is removed from the public prop type, so the attempt is a compile error
 * rather than a quiet hole.
 *
 * It sits at `src/components/` rather than under `admin/` because `Header` is
 * shared chrome on every gated page: the import graph is app-wide even though
 * the only provider is on one route.
