/**
 * The client boundary for theming. `attribute="class"` is not a preference: the
 * palette in `globals.css` is keyed on `.dark` via
 * `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))`, so the class is what the tokens
 * already respond to.
 *
 * This provider governs operator chrome only. Mount it on the operator SPA
 * shell, never on a room-facing route. The presenter and slide-grid surfaces
 * pin `.dark` on their own wrappers and keep winning for their own subtree;
 * the projected output paints in literal colours and never reads a theme token
 * at all (pinned by `tests/theme-chrome.test.mjs`).
 *
 * `disableTransitionOnChange` because this shell is full of `transition-all`:
 * every nav pill from `header-chrome`, the profile button, the logo tile, the
 * dropdown items and every `buttonVariants` control. Without the flag a theme
 * flip animates all of them at once and the shell smears through an
 * intermediate palette instead of repainting — on the one control whose job is
 * to make the change read as deliberate. next-themes ships the flag for exactly
 * this: it injects a `* { transition: none }` rule for one frame.
