/**
 * The operator may choose a theme; the congregation may never see the choice.
 *
 * Story 17.1 makes the shipped `.dark` palette selectable. Its load-bearing
 * constraint is not the switch — it is that nothing an operator picks can reach
 * the projected output. That is true today by construction: the projected tree
 * paints in literal colours (`bg-black`, `bg-[#0B1220]`) or in inline styles
 * resolved out of the Artifact Registry, and never in a theme token. Nothing
 * enforced it, so a single `bg-card` added to `SlideView` during unrelated work
 * would restyle the deck the congregation sees, with a theme toggle as the
 * trigger and no test to catch it.
 *
 * **Scope, after code review round 2.** AC-4 is guaranteed on two axes and this
 * file is the net for both: *what* — the projected tree paints in literals or
 * registry-resolved inline styles; and *where* — the projected output, not the
 * operator's own preview of it (`SlidePreviewList` is hub chrome and follows the
 * theme deliberately). Story 17.7 extended this same net to the *shell behind*
 * a projected route — SPA fallbacks and `spa/projected.html` first paint.
 * `FULL_SCREEN` still covers the client hook defence; structural discovery from
 * `src/projected` covers the room-facing React clients.
 *
 * The projected surface is two routes, and each is a route shell plus a client
 * tree. Both halves are guarded, because the shell is reached at the same URL
 * whenever `buildSlidePlan` throws:
 *
 *   spa/src/pages/SlideshowPage.tsx -> SlideshowClient -> SlideView -> ArtifactSlide
 *   spa/src/pages/ProjectorPage.tsx -> ProjectorClient -> SlideView -> ArtifactSlide
 *
 * The closure test starts at every route special file in the projected group,
 * walks *out of* them transitively, and requires every module it reaches to be
 * guarded or token-free — no directory is exempt by name. The route group is
 * the structural upward boundary, so a new shell joins without a leaf list.
 *
 * **Every scan strips comments first**, with a scanner rather than a regex.
 * Four assertions here were satisfiable by a word in a comment before
 * 2026-07-31 — one of them by the very comment that explained the code it was
 * meant to guard. Prose about a token is not a token, and a test that a doc
 * comment can keep green is not a test.
 *
 * **Not everything here is a regex.** The shell claim and the theme cycle are
 * exercised as behaviour, against a document stub and by calling the function.
 * The restore path in particular is where a bug leaves the operator's whole app
 * shell pinned at literal black after they leave a projected route, and no
 * amount of source matching reaches it.
 *
 * The token list is parsed out of `globals.css` rather than hardcoded, so a
 * token added to the palette is covered here without anyone remembering to
 * come back. AC-4 of the story is the requirement; this is its regression net.

 * already registered above them. While the module is suspended the runner starts
 * the tests it has, so every `const` declared *below* the await is still in its
 * temporal dead zone when those tests run. `jsxReturnBranches` is a hoisted
 * function declaration and stayed callable; `branchSurfaceRoot`, the arrow it
 * called, did not — so both AC-4 full-screen guards died with *"Cannot access
 * 'branchSurfaceRoot' before initialization"*.
 *
 * It is a race, not a version rule: it is lost whenever the import takes long
 * enough for the runner to get going first. CI (Node 22, resolving `.ts` through
 * the strip-types loader) lost it every time; Node 24 locally resolved the same
 * import fast enough to win, so the file was green on developer machines and red
 * on CI alone. Substituting a 50ms timer for the import reproduces the identical
 * ReferenceError on Node 24 too.
 *
 * The defect is not the scheduling; it is a test running against a half-evaluated
 * module at all. Hoisting both imports above the first `test()` — which is what
 * every other file in `tests/` already does — makes that unreachable rather than
 * merely fixed, and no future helper added below can reintroduce it.

/**
 * Comments removed, strings and regex literals kept, so no assertion below can
 * be satisfied by prose and none can be broken by prose either.
 *
 * This is a scanner and not a pair of regexes, because both regexes were wrong
 * in opposite directions. `/\/\*[\s\S]*?\*\//g` deletes real code whenever a
 * `*&#47;` appears inside a string literal, and dropping only lines that *begin*
 * with `//` re-admitted the exact false positive the mechanism exists to remove:
 * a trailing `// use bg-card here instead` counted as a token reference. Walking
 * the source solves both at once — a `//` inside `xmlns="http://…"` is inside a
 * string, so it is passed through untouched, which is what the line-start rule
 * was a workaround for.
 *
 * **Regex literals are a third quoting form and are now scanned as one.** The
 * character scanner treated `'`, `"` and `` ` `` as string openers
 * unconditionally, which broke in both directions on real files in `src/`:
 *
 *   - a quote inside a regex opened a phantom string. `src/lib/parser.ts:130`
 *     (`/\s+"[^"]*"\s*$/`) swallowed 454 characters and 8,619 more, and
 *     `src/lib/lyrics.ts` did it at eight sites — after which comments in those
 *     files were not stripped at all. Both are `.ts` modules this file feeds
 *     through `themeReferences()` whenever a projected file imports them.
 *   - `value.split(/\//)` was outside a string at the backslash, so the `//`
 *     read as a line comment and **the rest of that line was deleted from the
 *     scan** — a live theme token on it would have passed the AC-4 guard by not
 *     being there. That is the dangerous direction, and it is the reason this is
 *     fixed rather than documented as a limit.
 *
 * Comment openers are still tested *first* in JS position: neither `/*` nor `//`
 * can begin a regex (`*` has nothing to repeat, and `//` is the empty regex,
 * spelled `/(?:)/`), so ordering them first is exact rather than a compromise —
 * and it keeps `foo(/*inline*&#47; x)`, where an expression may begin, a comment.
 *
 * **JSX children are a fourth quoting form and are now scanned as one.** That
 * ordering argument covers regex literals and says nothing about element text,
 * where the scanner fired the comment branch unconditionally:
 *
 *   - `<p>Docs: https://example.test/reset <span className="bg-card …">` — the
 *     `//` in the URL read as a line comment and **the rest of the line was
 *     deleted from the scan**, hiding a live `bg-card`, a `dark:` variant and a
 *     `border-2` from four AC-4 guards at once. One URL in room-facing copy.
 *   - `<p>ratio 3 /* 4</p>` is worse: `indexOf('*&#47;')` misses and the
 *     **remainder of the file** is discarded.
 *
 * `walkJsx` already models this (`inChildren`), and `stripComments` feeds
 * `walkJsx` — so the guard that knew the rule ran downstream of the one that did
 * not. Attribute position is deliberately *not* children: a comment inside
 * `className={cn('a', /* … *&#47; 'b')}` is a comment, and removing it is the
 * whole point, so an opening tag's interior is scanned rather than skipped whole.

/**
 * A second way the theme reaches the projected tree, found while verifying AC-4
 * in the browser rather than by reading the source.
 *
 * `globals.css` applies `border-border` through a universal selector
 * (`@layer base { * { @apply border-border outline-ring/50 } }`), so EVERY node
 * in the projected tree already computes a theme-dependent `border-color` —
 * `#e5e5e5` light against `oklch(1 0 0 / 10%)` dark. It paints nothing while
 * Tailwind's preflight leaves `border-width: 0`, which was confirmed node by
 * node on `/services/[id]/slideshow`: 14 of 14 elements at `0px` on all four
 * sides, **with nothing focused**. That last clause matters and was missing:
 * the same universal rule sets `outline-color` from `--ring`, and the UA
 * supplies the width on `:focus-visible`, so a focused link on a projected
 * surface paints a ring in the operator's theme. The three projected focusables
 * now state `focus-visible:outline-white`, asserted below.
 *
 * So the token guard above is necessary but not sufficient. The class that
 * would turn that inert colour into a painted, theme-varying edge is a *width*,
 * which contains no token name and sails straight past a token scan. A projected
 * element that genuinely wants an edge has to state its own colour, the way
 * `ProjectorClient` states `bg-[#0B1220]`, or draw it from registry-resolved
 * inline style.
 *
 * The width vocabulary is larger than it looks and the first version of this
 * guard missed most of it — including `ring-1`, the exact hazard its own comment
 * named. Directional widths, arbitrary values, odd ring and outline widths,
 * divider widths, the arbitrary-property form (`[border-width:2px]`) and the
 * inline-style form (`style={{ borderWidth: 1 }}`) are all painted edges. A
 * colour-only utility (`border-white/25`) is deliberately NOT matched: it paints
 * nothing without a width, and stating a literal colour is the sanctioned way
 * out of this guard.
 *
 * `body { @apply text-foreground }` is the same shape of hazard for TEXT. Both
 * full-screen surfaces now state `text-white` on their own root, so it is closed
 * structurally rather than resting on `ArtifactSlide.tsx`'s literal `#FFFFFF`
 * fallback for registry text — which still holds, and still matters for any node
 * the wrapper does not reach.

 *
 * `outline-current` is deliberately allowed: it resolves to the element's own

 * The props of the file's default-exported component, as source — the inline

 *
 * Reading the literal parentheses alone was enough to defeat this: `Header.tsx:9`
 * already uses the `interface HeaderProps` + `function Header(…: HeaderProps)`
 * shape, so it is house style rather than a contrivance. The deleted parameter is
 * what makes a spread, a `React.createElement` call and a `.ts` call site fail to
 * compile — and that property disappears the moment props are re-declared, with
 * this guard the only thing standing there.
 *
 * **Following the name and then reading only its first `{ … }` moved the wall by
 * exactly one spelling.** `balancedBlock` returns the object literal and never
 * the other half of an intersection or an `extends` base, so
 * `type SlideViewProps = React.ComponentProps<'div'> & { slide: SlidePlanItem }`
 * with `{...rest}` on the wrapper was **47/47 green and `tsc --noEmit` clean**,
 * with `<SlideView slide={s} className="bg-card" />` compiling and landing

 * the same. That is house style here too — `React.ComponentProps<"div">` at
 * `ui/card.tsx`, `ui/dialog.tsx`, `ui/popover.tsx`, and `ButtonPrimitive.Props &
 * VariantProps<…>` at `ui/button.tsx:47`.
 *
 * So the rule is stated rather than the spelling: these props must be composed
 * only of inline object literals and types declared in this same file. Anything
 * else — an import, a namespaced type, a utility type — fails **loudly**, because
 * a guard that cannot read the shape it asserts about must say so instead of
 * passing. `React.ComponentProps<'div'>` is not a hypothetical member to reject:

 * The root elements of every JSX-returning branch of the exported surface: one

 * each branch instead of about one element of one branch.
 *
 * Two narrowings lived here, and both were the same shape — a rule stated
 * broadly and applied to whichever spelling the author had in front of them.
 *
 *   - It took `classNameValues(body)[0]`, the first `className` in source order,
 *     while its own failure message called that "the OUTERMOST classed element".
 *     Any early return carrying a className (loading, empty, error) silently
 *     became the checked element.
 *   - It then matched `/return\s*\(\s*(?=<)/`, so a **branch** was defined as a
 *     parenthesised return. A paren-less `return <div …>;` — the house style at
 *     `src/components/SlideView.tsx:19` — was not a branch at all, and a
 *     component mixing both styles was checked on half its branches and stayed
 *     green. That is the silent-skip the rewrite existed to close, one level up.
 *
 * A render branch is now any `return` whose expression contains JSX, however it
 * is written, and it reports the **outermost classed element** under each
 * top-level root — so `return cond ? <A/> : <B/>` yields two and both are
 * checked. An effect cleanup (`return () => …`) contains no element and is not a
 * branch, which no longer depends on how its parentheses fall.
 *
 * *Outermost classed*, not *root*, because a context provider carries no
 * `className` and paints nothing: `SlideGridDialog` returns `<Dialog>` whose
 * child `<DialogContent>` is the portalled surface that has to declare `dark`,
 * and its own comment says so. `undefined` is reported for a root with nothing
 * classed beneath it at all, which is a branch a caller should reject rather
 * than skip.
 *
 * **And "outermost classed" was still implemented as "first classed in source
 * order", which is a third spelling of the same defect.** Under an unclassed
 * provider root, first-in-pre-order is whichever CHILD comes first in the file,
 * not the one that paints. It failed both ways: a `<span className="dark
 * sr-only" />` placed before `<DialogContent>` satisfied the AC-3 guard with
 * `dark` stripped from the real surface (47/47 green), and any classed non-dark
 * sibling placed there — the `<DialogTitle className="sr-only">` shadcn's
 * accessibility guidance asks for — failed the guard on correct code.
 *
 * It descends the single-element chain instead: the surface root is the first
 * classed element on the way down, and a level with more than one element and no
 * class above it is **ambiguous and says so**, because at that point nothing in
 * the source distinguishes the container from its sibling.
 *
 * A declaration rather than a `const` arrow, to match its only caller. A hoisted
 * `jsxReturnBranches` calling a `const` was the asymmetry that let the CI failure
 * reach a ReferenceError instead of never being callable at all.
