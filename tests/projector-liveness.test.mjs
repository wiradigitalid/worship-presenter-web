/**
 * Whether the presenter can tell the projector is still there (Story 17.5,
 * `AD-29`).
 *
 * `AD-29` fixes the shape this file exists to enforce: **one evaluator, one
 * predicate.** Acknowledgement staleness and the retained handle's `closed`
 * read are two *inputs* to a single reducer, never two mechanisms with two
 * verdicts — a reviewer must be able to fail an implementation in which the
 * poll keeps its own flag or renders its own message. The reducer takes every
 * time value as an argument and never reads the clock itself, which is what
 * lets a fake timeline drive it deterministically here.
 *
 * Three kinds of assertion, matching `tests/canvas-dirty-guard.test.mjs`'s
 * split: the evaluator is a plain `.ts` module with no React and no `window`,
 * so `node:test` calls it directly; the wire half (the new message type
 * resolving to `null` through both readers) lives in
 * `tests/present-channel.test.mjs`, which already owns that question; and the
 * wiring this repo cannot exercise — a real `BroadcastChannel`, a real
 * interval, a real `window.closed` — is covered by the TypeScript-AST style
 * `tests/canvas-dirty-guard.test.mjs` uses, so a second liveness state hidden
 * inside a component is a source-shape defect a scan can catch rather than a
 * behaviour only a browser could show.
